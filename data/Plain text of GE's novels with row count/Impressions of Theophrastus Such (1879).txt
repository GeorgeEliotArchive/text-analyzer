70: LOOKING INWARD.
71: 
72: It is my habit to give an account to myself of the characters I meet
73: with: can I give any true account of my own? I am a bachelor, without
74: domestic distractions of any sort, and have all my life been an
75: attentive companion to myself, flattering my nature agreeably on
76: plausible occasions, reviling it rather bitterly when it mortified me,
77: and in general remembering its doings and sufferings with a tenacity
78: which is too apt to raise surprise if not disgust at the careless
79: inaccuracy of my acquaintances, who impute to me opinions I never held,
80: express their desire to convert me to my favourite ideas, forget whether
81: I have ever been to the East, and are capable of being three several
82: times astonished at my never having told them before of my accident in
83: the Alps, causing me the nervous shock which has ever since notably
84: diminished my digestive powers. Surely I ought to know myself better
85: than these indifferent outsiders can know me; nay, better even than my
86: intimate friends, to whom I have never breathed those items of my inward
87: experience which have chiefly shaped my life.
88: 
89: Yet I have often been forced into the reflection that even the
90: acquaintances who are as forgetful of my biography and tenets as they
91: would be if I were a dead philosopher, are probably aware of certain
92: points in me which may not be included in my most active suspicion. We
93: sing an exquisite passage out of tune and innocently repeat it for the
94: greater pleasure of our hearers. Who can be aware of what his foreign
95: accent is in the ears of a native? And how can a man be conscious of
96: that dull perception which causes him to mistake altogether what will
97: make him agreeable to a particular woman, and to persevere eagerly in a
98: behaviour which she is privately recording against him? I have had some
99: confidences from my female friends as to their opinion of other men whom
100: I have observed trying to make themselves amiable, and it has occurred
101: to me that though I can hardly be so blundering as Lippus and the rest
102: of those mistaken candidates for favour whom I have seen ruining their
103: chance by a too elaborate personal canvass, I must still come under the
104: common fatality of mankind and share the liability to be absurd without
105: knowing that I am absurd. It is in the nature of foolish reasoning to
106: seem good to the foolish reasoner. Hence with all possible study of
107: myself, with all possible effort to escape from the pitiable illusion
108: which makes men laugh, shriek, or curl the lip at Folly's likeness, in
109: total unconsciousness that it resembles themselves, I am obliged to
110: recognise that while there are secrets in me unguessed by others, these
111: others have certain items of knowledge about the extent of my powers and
112: the figure I make with them, which in turn are secrets unguessed by me.
113: When I was a lad I danced a hornpipe with arduous scrupulosity, and
114: while suffering pangs of pallid shyness was yet proud of my superiority
115: as a dancing pupil, imagining for myself a high place in the estimation
116: of beholders; but I can now picture the amusement they had in the
117: incongruity of my solemn face and ridiculous legs. What sort of hornpipe
118: am I dancing now?
119: 
120: Thus if I laugh at you, O fellow-men! if I trace with curious interest
121: your labyrinthine self-delusions, note the inconsistencies in your
122: zealous adhesions, and smile at your helpless endeavours in a rashly
123: chosen part, it is not that I feel myself aloof from you: the more
124: intimately I seem to discern your weaknesses, the stronger to me is the
125: proof that I share them. How otherwise could I get the discernment?--for
126: even what we are averse to, what we vow not to entertain, must have
127: shaped or shadowed itself within us as a possibility before we can think
128: of exorcising it. No man can know his brother simply as a spectator.
129: Dear blunderers, I am one of you. I wince at the fact, but I am not
130: ignorant of it, that I too am laughable on unsuspected occasions; nay,
131: in the very tempest and whirlwind of my anger, I include myself under my
132: own indignation. If the human race has a bad reputation, I perceive that
133: I cannot escape being compromised. And thus while I carry in myself the
134: key to other men's experience, it is only by observing others that I can
135: so far correct my self-ignorance as to arrive at the certainty that I am
136: liable to commit myself unawares and to manifest some incompetency which
137: I know no more of than the blind man knows of his image in the glass.
138: 
139: Is it then possible to describe oneself at once faithfully and fully? In
140: all autobiography there is, nay, ought to be, an incompleteness which
141: may have the effect of falsity. We are each of us bound to reticence by
142: the piety we owe to those who have been nearest to us and have had a
143: mingled influence over our lives; by the fellow-feeling which should
144: restrain us from turning our volunteered and picked confessions into an
145: act of accusation against others, who have no chance of vindicating
146: themselves; and most of all by that reverence for the higher efforts of
147: our common nature, which commands us to bury its lowest fatalities, its
148: invincible remnants of the brute, its most agonising struggles with
149: temptation, in unbroken silence. But the incompleteness which comes of
150: self-ignorance may be compensated by self-betrayal. A man who is
151: affected to tears in dwelling on the generosity of his own sentiments
152: makes me aware of several things not included under those terms. Who has
153: sinned more against those three duteous reticences than Jean Jacques?
154: Yet half our impressions of his character come not from what he means to
155: convey, but from what he unconsciously enables us to discern.
156: 
157: This _naïve_ veracity of self-presentation is attainable by the
158: slenderest talent on the most trivial occasions. The least lucid and
159: impressive of orators may be perfectly successful in showing us the weak
160: points of his grammar. Hence I too may be so far like Jean Jacques as to
161: communicate more than I am aware of. I am not indeed writing an
162: autobiography, or pretending to give an unreserved description of
163: myself, but only offering some slight confessions in an apologetic
164: light, to indicate that if in my absence you dealt as freely with my
165: unconscious weaknesses as I have dealt with the unconscious weaknesses
166: of others, I should not feel myself warranted by common-sense in
167: regarding your freedom of observation as an exceptional case of
168: evil-speaking; or as malignant interpretation of a character which
169: really offers no handle to just objection; or even as an unfair use for
170: your amusement of disadvantages which, since they are mine, should be
171: regarded with more than ordinary tenderness. Let me at least try to feel
172: myself in the ranks with my fellow-men. It is true, that I would rather
173: not hear either your well-founded ridicule or your judicious strictures.
174: Though not averse to finding fault with myself, and conscious of
175: deserving lashes, I like to keep the scourge in my own discriminating
176: hand. I never felt myself sufficiently meritorious to like being hated
177: as a proof of my superiority, or so thirsty for improvement as to desire
178: that all my acquaintances should give me their candid opinion of me. I
179: really do not want to learn from my enemies: I prefer having none to
180: learn from. Instead of being glad when men use me despitefully, I wish
181: they would behave better and find a more amiable occupation for their
182: intervals of business. In brief, after a close intimacy with myself for
183: a longer period than I choose to mention, I find within me a permanent
184: longing for approbation, sympathy, and love.
185: 
186: Yet I am a bachelor, and the person I love best has never loved me, or
187: known that I loved her. Though continually in society, and caring about
188: the joys and sorrows of my neighbours, I feel myself, so far as my
189: personal lot is concerned, uncared for and alone. "Your own fault, my
190: dear fellow!" said Minutius Felix, one day that I had incautiously
191: mentioned this uninteresting fact. And he was right--in senses other
192: than he intended. Why should I expect to be admired, and have my company
193: doated on? I have done no services to my country beyond those of every
194: peaceable orderly citizen; and as to intellectual contribution, my only
195: published work was a failure, so that I am spoken of to inquiring
196: beholders as "the author of a book you have probably not seen." (The
197: work was a humorous romance, unique in its kind, and I am told is much
198: tasted in a Cherokee translation, where the jokes are rendered with all
199: the serious eloquence characteristic of the Red races.) This sort of
200: distinction, as a writer nobody is likely to have read, can hardly
201: counteract an indistinctness in my articulation, which the
202: best-intentioned loudness will not remedy. Then, in some quarters my
203: awkward feet are against me, the length of my upper lip, and an
204: inveterate way I have of walking with my head foremost and my chin
205: projecting. One can become only too well aware of such things by looking
206: in the glass, or in that other mirror held up to nature in the frank
207: opinions of street-boys, or of our Free People travelling by excursion
208: train; and no doubt they account for the half-suppressed smile which I
209: have observed on some fair faces when I have first been presented before
210: them. This direct perceptive judgment is not to be argued against. But I
211: am tempted to remonstrate when the physical points I have mentioned are
212: apparently taken to warrant unfavourable inferences concerning my mental
213: quickness. With all the increasing uncertainty which modern progress has
214: thrown over the relations of mind and body, it seems tolerably clear
215: that wit cannot be seated in the upper lip, and that the balance of the
216: haunches in walking has nothing to do with the subtle discrimination of
217: ideas. Yet strangers evidently do not expect me to make a clever
218: observation, and my good things are as unnoticed as if they were
219: anonymous pictures. I have indeed had the mixed satisfaction of finding
220: that when they were appropriated by some one else they were found
221: remarkable and even brilliant. It is to be borne in mind that I am not
222: rich, have neither stud nor cellar, and no very high connections such as
223: give to a look of imbecility a certain prestige of inheritance through a
224: titled line; just as "the Austrian lip" confers a grandeur of historical
225: associations on a kind of feature which might make us reject an
226: advertising footman. I have now and then done harm to a good cause by
227: speaking for it in public, and have discovered too late that my attitude
228: on the occasion would more suitably have been that of negative
229: beneficence. Is it really to the advantage of an opinion that I should
230: be known to hold it? And as to the force of my arguments, that is a
231: secondary consideration with audiences who have given a new scope to the
232: _ex pede Herculem_ principle, and from awkward feet infer awkward
233: fallacies. Once, when zeal lifted me on my legs, I distinctly heard an
234: enlightened artisan remark, "Here's a rum cut!"--and doubtless he
235: reasoned in the same way as the elegant Glycera when she politely puts
236: on an air of listening to me, but elevates her eyebrows and chills her
237: glance in sign of predetermined neutrality: both have their reasons for
238: judging the quality of my speech beforehand.
239: 
240: This sort of reception to a man of affectionate disposition, who has
241: also the innocent vanity of desiring to be agreeable, has naturally a
242: depressing if not embittering tendency; and in early life I began to
243: seek for some consoling point of view, some warrantable method of
244: softening the hard peas I had to walk on, some comfortable fanaticism
245: which might supply the needed self-satisfaction. At one time I dwelt
246: much on the idea of compensation; trying to believe that I was all the
247: wiser for my bruised vanity, that I had the higher place in the true
248: spiritual scale, and even that a day might come when some visible
249: triumph would place me in the French heaven of having the laughers on my
250: side. But I presently perceived that this was a very odious sort of
251: self-cajolery. Was it in the least true that I was wiser than several of
252: my friends who made an excellent figure, and were perhaps praised a
253: little beyond their merit? Is the ugly unready man in the corner,
254: outside the current of conversation, really likely to have a fairer
255: view of things than the agreeable talker, whose success strikes the
256: unsuccessful as a repulsive example of forwardness and conceit? And as
257: to compensation in future years, would the fact that I myself got it
258: reconcile me to an order of things in which I could see a multitude with
259: as bad a share as mine, who, instead of getting their corresponding
260: compensation, were getting beyond the reach of it in old age? What could
261: be more contemptible than the mood of mind which makes a man measure the
262: justice of divine or human law by the agreeableness of his own shadow
263: and the ample satisfaction of his own desires?
264: 
265: I dropped a form of consolation which seemed to be encouraging me in the
266: persuasion that my discontent was the chief evil in the world, and my
267: benefit the soul of good in that evil. May there not be at least a
268: partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philosophy is
269: the formula of his personality? In certain branches of science we can
270: ascertain our personal equation, the measure of difference between our
271: own judgments and an average standard: may there not be some
272: corresponding correction of our personal partialities in moral
273: theorising? If a squint or other ocular defect disturbs my vision, I can
274: get instructed in the fact, be made aware that my condition is abnormal,
275: and either through spectacles or diligent imagination I can learn the
276: average appearance of things: is there no remedy or corrective for that
277: inward squint which consists in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of
278: mental balance? In my conscience I saw that the bias of personal
279: discontent was just as misleading and odious as the bias of
280: self-satisfaction. Whether we look through the rose-coloured glass or
281: the indigo, we are equally far from the hues which the healthy human eye
282: beholds in heaven above and earth below. I began to dread ways of
283: consoling which were really a flattering of native illusions, a
284: feeding-up into monstrosity of an inward growth already
285: disproportionate; to get an especial scorn for that scorn of mankind
286: which is a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claims; to watch
287: with peculiar alarm lest what I called my philosophic estimate of the
288: human lot in general, should be a mere prose lyric expressing my own
289: pain and consequent bad temper. The standing-ground worth striving after
290: seemed to be some Delectable Mountain, whence I could see things in
291: proportions as little as possible determined by that self-partiality
292: which certainly plays a necessary part in our bodily sustenance, but has
293: a starving effect on the mind.
294: 
295: Thus I finally gave up any attempt to make out that I preferred cutting
296: a bad figure, and that I liked to be despised, because in this way I was
297: getting more virtuous than my successful rivals; and I have long looked
298: with suspicion on all views which are recommended as peculiarly
299: consolatory to wounded vanity or other personal disappointment. The
300: consolations of egoism are simply a change of attitude or a resort to a
301: new kind of diet which soothes and fattens it. Fed in this way it is apt
302: to become a monstrous spiritual pride, or a chuckling satisfaction that
303: the final balance will not be against us but against those who now
304: eclipse us. Examining the world in order to find consolation is very
305: much like looking carefully over the pages of a great book in order to
306: find our own name, if not in the text, at least in a laudatory note:
307: whether we find what we want or not, our preoccupation has hindered us
308: from a true knowledge of the contents. But an attention fixed on the
309: main theme or various matter of the book would deliver us from that
310: slavish subjection to our own self-importance. And I had the mighty
311: volume of the world before me. Nay, I had the struggling action of a
312: myriad lives around me, each single life as dear to itself as mine to
313: me. Was there no escape here from this stupidity of a murmuring
314: self-occupation? Clearly enough, if anything hindered my thought from
315: rising to the force of passionately interested contemplation, or my poor
316: pent-up pond of sensitiveness from widening into a beneficent river of
317: sympathy, it was my own dulness; and though I could not make myself the
318: reverse of shallow all at once, I had at least learned where I had
319: better turn my attention.
320: 
321: Something came of this alteration in my point of view, though I admit
322: that the result is of no striking kind. It is unnecessary for me to
323: utter modest denials, since none have assured me that I have a vast
324: intellectual scope, or--what is more surprising, considering I have
325: done so little--that I might, if I chose, surpass any distinguished man
326: whom they wish to depreciate. I have not attained any lofty peak of
327: magnanimity, nor would I trust beforehand in my capability of meeting a
328: severe demand for moral heroism. But that I have at least succeeded in
329: establishing a habit of mind which keeps watch against my
330: self-partiality and promotes a fair consideration of what touches the
331: feelings or the fortunes of my neighbours, seems to be proved by the
332: ready confidence with which men and women appeal to my interest in their
333: experience. It is gratifying to one who would above all things avoid the
334: insanity of fancying himself a more momentous or touching object than he
335: really is, to find that nobody expects from him the least sign of such
336: mental aberration, and that he is evidently held capable of listening to
337: all kinds of personal outpouring without the least disposition to become
338: communicative in the same way. This confirmation of the hope that my
339: bearing is not that of the self-flattering lunatic is given me in ample
340: measure. My acquaintances tell me unreservedly of their triumphs and
341: their piques; explain their purposes at length, and reassure me with
342: cheerfulness as to their chances of success; insist on their theories
343: and accept me as a dummy with whom they rehearse their side of future
344: discussions; unwind their coiled-up griefs in relation to their
345: husbands, or recite to me examples of feminine incomprehensibleness as
346: typified in their wives; mention frequently the fair applause which
347: their merits have wrung from some persons, and the attacks to which
348: certain oblique motives have stimulated others. At the time when I was
349: less free from superstition about my own power of charming, I
350: occasionally, in the glow of sympathy which embraced me and my confiding
351: friend on the subject of his satisfaction or resentment, was urged to
352: hint at a corresponding experience in my own case; but the signs of a
353: rapidly lowering pulse and spreading nervous depression in my previously
354: vivacious interlocutor, warned me that I was acting on that dangerous
355: misreading, "Do as you are done by." Recalling the true version of the
356: golden rule, I could not wish that others should lower my spirits as I
357: was lowering my friend's. After several times obtaining the same result
358: from a like experiment in which all the circumstances were varied except
359: my own personality, I took it as an established inference that these
360: fitful signs of a lingering belief in my own importance were generally
361: felt to be abnormal, and were something short of that sanity which I
362: aimed to secure. Clearness on this point is not without its
363: gratifications, as I have said. While my desire to explain myself in
364: private ears has been quelled, the habit of getting interested in the
365: experience of others has been continually gathering strength, and I am
366: really at the point of finding that this world would be worth living in
367: without any lot of one's own. Is it not possible for me to enjoy the
368: scenery of the earth without saying to myself, I have a cabbage-garden
369: in it? But this sounds like the lunacy of fancying oneself everybody
370: else and being unable to play one's own part decently--another form of
371: the disloyal attempt to be independent of the common lot, and to live
372: without a sharing of pain.
373: 
374: Perhaps I have made self-betrayals enough already to show that I have
375: not arrived at that non-human independence. My conversational
376: reticences about myself turn into garrulousness on paper--as the
377: sea-lion plunges and swims the more energetically because his limbs are
378: of a sort to make him shambling on land. The act of writing, in spite of
379: past experience, brings with it the vague, delightful illusion of an
380: audience nearer to my idiom than the Cherokees, and more numerous than
381: the visionary One for whom many authors have declared themselves willing
382: to go through the pleasing punishment of publication. My illusion is of
383: a more liberal kind, and I imagine a far-off, hazy, multitudinous
384: assemblage, as in a picture of Paradise, making an approving chorus to
385: the sentences and paragraphs of which I myself particularly enjoy the
386: writing. The haze is a necessary condition. If any physiognomy becomes
387: distinct in the foreground, it is fatal. The countenance is sure to be
388: one bent on discountenancing my innocent intentions: it is pale-eyed,
389: incapable of being amused when I am amused or indignant at what makes me
390: indignant; it stares at my presumption, pities my ignorance, or is
391: manifestly preparing to expose the various instances in which I
392: unconsciously disgrace myself. I shudder at this too corporeal auditor,
393: and turn towards another point of the compass where the haze is
394: unbroken. Why should I not indulge this remaining illusion, since I do
395: not take my approving choral paradise as a warrant for setting the press
396: to work again and making some thousand sheets of superior paper
397: unsaleable? I leave my manuscripts to a judgment outside my imagination,
398: but I will not ask to hear it, or request my friend to pronounce, before
399: I have been buried decently, what he really thinks of my parts, and to
400: state candidly whether my papers would be most usefully applied in
401: lighting the cheerful domestic fire. It is too probable that he will be
402: exasperated at the trouble I have given him of reading them; but the
403: consequent clearness and vivacity with which he could demonstrate to me
404: that the fault of my manuscripts, as of my one published work, is simply
405: flatness, and not that surpassing subtilty which is the preferable
406: ground of popular neglect--this verdict, however instructively
407: expressed, is a portion of earthly discipline of which I will not
408: beseech my friend to be the instrument. Other persons, I am aware, have
409: not the same cowardly shrinking from a candid opinion of their
410: performances, and are even importunately eager for it; but I have
411: convinced myself in numerous cases that such exposers of their own back
412: to the smiter were of too hopeful a disposition to believe in the
413: scourge, and really trusted in a pleasant anointing, an outpouring of
414: balm without any previous wounds. I am of a less trusting disposition,
415: and will only ask my friend to use his judgment in insuring me against
416: posthumous mistake.
417: 
418: Thus I make myself a charter to write, and keep the pleasing, inspiring
419: illusion of being listened to, though I may sometimes write about
420: myself. What I have already said on this too familiar theme has been
421: meant only as a preface, to show that in noting the weaknesses of my
422: acquaintances I am conscious of my fellowship with them. That a
423: gratified sense of superiority is at the root of barbarous laughter may
424: be at least half the truth. But there is a loving laughter in which the
425: only recognised superiority is that of the ideal self, the God within,
426: holding the mirror and the scourge for our own pettiness as well as our
427: neighbours'.

432: II.
433: 
434: 
435: LOOKING BACKWARD.
436: 
437: Most of us who have had decent parents would shrink from wishing that
438: our father and mother had been somebody else whom we never knew; yet it
439: is held no impiety, rather, a graceful mark of instruction, for a man to
440: wail that he was not the son of another age and another nation, of which
441: also he knows nothing except through the easy process of an imperfect
442: imagination and a flattering fancy.
443: 
444: But the period thus looked back on with a purely admiring regret, as
445: perfect enough to suit a superior mind, is always a long way off; the
446: desirable contemporaries are hardly nearer than Leonardo da Vinci, most
447: likely they are the fellow-citizens of Pericles, or, best of all, of the
448: Aeolic lyrists whose sparse remains suggest a comfortable contrast with
449: our redundance. No impassioned personage wishes he had been born in the
450: age of Pitt, that his ardent youth might have eaten the dearest bread,
451: dressed itself with the longest coat-tails and the shortest waist, or
452: heard the loudest grumbling at the heaviest war-taxes; and it would be
453: really something original in polished verse if one of our young writers
454: declared he would gladly be turned eighty-five that he might have known
455: the joy and pride of being an Englishman when there were fewer reforms
456: and plenty of highwaymen, fewer discoveries and more faces pitted with
457: the small-pox, when laws were made to keep up the price of corn, and the
458: troublesome Irish were more miserable. Three-quarters of a century ago
459: is not a distance that lends much enchantment to the view. We are
460: familiar with the average men of that period, and are still consciously
461: encumbered with its bad contrivances and mistaken acts. The lords and
462: gentlemen painted by young Lawrence talked and wrote their nonsense in a
463: tongue we thoroughly understand; hence their times are not much
464: flattered, not much glorified by the yearnings of that modern sect of
465: Flagellants who make a ritual of lashing--not themselves but--all their
466: neighbours. To me, however, that paternal time, the time of my father's
467: youth, never seemed prosaic, for it came to my imagination first through
468: his memories, which made a wondrous perspective to my little daily world
469: of discovery. And for my part I can call no age absolutely unpoetic: how
470: should it be so, since there are always children to whom the acorns and
471: the swallow's eggs are a wonder, always those human passions and
472: fatalities through which Garrick as Hamlet in bob-wig and knee-breeches
473: moved his audience more than some have since done in velvet tunic and
474: plume? But every age since the golden may be made more or less prosaic
475: by minds that attend only to its vulgar and sordid elements, of which
476: there was always an abundance even in Greece and Italy, the favourite
477: realms of the retrospective optimists. To be quite fair towards the
478: ages, a little ugliness as well as beauty must be allowed to each of
479: them, a little implicit poetry even to those which echoed loudest with
480: servile, pompous, and trivial prose.
481: 
482: Such impartiality is not in vogue at present. If we acknowledge our
483: obligation to the ancients, it is hardly to be done without some
484: flouting of our contemporaries, who with all their faults must be
485: allowed the merit of keeping the world habitable for the refined
486: eulogists of the blameless past. One wonders whether the remarkable
487: originators who first had the notion of digging wells, or of churning
488: for butter, and who were certainly very useful to their own time as well
489: as ours, were left quite free from invidious comparison with
490: predecessors who let the water and the milk alone, or whether some
491: rhetorical nomad, as he stretched himself on the grass with a good
492: appetite for contemporary butter, became loud on the virtue of ancestors
493: who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow; nay, whether in a high
494: flight of imaginative self-sacrifice (after swallowing the butter) he
495: even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of
496: a generation more _naïve_ than his own.
497: 
498: I have often had the fool's hectic of wishing about the unalterable, but
499: with me that useless exercise has turned chiefly on the conception of a
500: different self, and not, as it usually does in literature, on the
501: advantage of having been born in a different age, and more especially in
502: one where life is imagined to have been altogether majestic and
503: graceful. With my present abilities, external proportions, and generally
504: small provision for ecstatic enjoyment, where is the ground for
505: confidence that I should have had a preferable career in such an epoch
506: of society? An age in which every department has its awkward-squad seems
507: in my mind's eye to suit me better. I might have wandered by the Strymon
508: under Philip and Alexander without throwing any new light on method or
509: organising the sum of human knowledge; on the other hand, I might have
510: objected to Aristotle as too much of a systematiser, and have preferred
511: the freedom of a little self-contradiction as offering more chances of
512: truth. I gather, too, from the undeniable testimony of his disciple
513: Theophrastus that there were bores, ill-bred persons, and detractors
514: even in Athens, of species remarkably corresponding to the English, and
515: not yet made endurable by being classic; and altogether, with my present
516: fastidious nostril, I feel that I am the better off for possessing
517: Athenian life solely as an inodorous fragment of antiquity. As to
518: Sappho's Mitylene, while I am convinced that the Lesbian capital held
519: some plain men of middle stature and slow conversational powers, the
520: addition of myself to their number, though clad in the majestic folds of
521: the himation and without cravat, would hardly have made a sensation
522: among the accomplished fair ones who were so precise in adjusting their
523: own drapery about their delicate ankles. Whereas by being another sort
524: of person in the present age I might have given it some needful
525: theoretic clue; or I might have poured forth poetic strains which would
526: have anticipated theory and seemed a voice from "the prophetic soul of
527: the wide world dreaming of things to come;" or I might have been one of
528: those benignant lovely souls who, without astonishing the public and
529: posterity, make a happy difference in the lives close around them, and
530: in this way lift the average of earthly joy: in some form or other I
531: might have been so filled from the store of universal existence that I
532: should have been freed from that empty wishing which is like a child's
533: cry to be inside a golden cloud, its imagination being too ignorant to
534: figure the lining of dimness and damp.
535: 
536: On the whole, though there is some rash boasting about enlightenment,
537: and an occasional insistance on an originality which is that of the
538: present year's corn-crop, we seem too much disposed to indulge, and to
539: call by complimentary names, a greater charity for other portions of the
540: human race than for our contemporaries. All reverence and gratitude for
541: the worthy Dead on whose labours we have entered, all care for the
542: future generations whose lot we are preparing; but some affection and
543: fairness for those who are doing the actual work of the world, some
544: attempt to regard them with the same freedom from ill-temper, whether on
545: private or public grounds, as we may hope will be felt by those who will
546: call us ancient! Otherwise, the looking before and after, which is our
547: grand human privilege, is in danger of turning to a sort of
548: other-worldliness, breeding a more illogical indifference or bitterness
549: than was ever bred by the ascetic's contemplation of heaven. Except on
550: the ground of a primitive golden age and continuous degeneracy, I see no
551: rational footing for scorning the whole present population of the globe,
552: unless I scorn every previous generation from whom they have inherited
553: their diseases of mind and body, and by consequence scorn my own scorn,
554: which is equally an inheritance of mixed ideas and feelings concocted
555: for me in the boiling caldron of this universally contemptible life, and
556: so on--scorning to infinity. This may represent some actual states of
557: mind, for it is a narrow prejudice of mathematicians to suppose that
558: ways of thinking are to be driven out of the field by being reduced to
559: an absurdity. The Absurd is taken as an excellent juicy thistle by many
560: constitutions.
561: 
562: Reflections of this sort have gradually determined me not to grumble at
563: the age in which I happen to have been born--a natural tendency
564: certainly older than Hesiod. Many ancient beautiful things are lost,
565: many ugly modern things have arisen; but invert the proposition and it
566: is equally true. I at least am a modern with some interest in advocating
567: tolerance, and notwithstanding an inborn beguilement which carries my
568: affection and regret continually into an imagined past, I am aware that
569: I must lose all sense of moral proportion unless I keep alive a stronger
570: attachment to what is near, and a power of admiring what I best know and
571: understand. Hence this question of wishing to be rid of one's
572: contemporaries associates itself with my filial feeling, and calls up
573: the thought that I might as justifiably wish that I had had other
574: parents than those whose loving tones are my earliest memory, and whose
575: last parting first taught me the meaning of death. I feel bound to quell
576: such a wish as blasphemy.
577: 
578: Besides, there are other reasons why I am contented that my father was a
579: country parson, born much about the same time as Scott and Wordsworth;
580: notwithstanding certain qualms I have felt at the fact that the property
581: on which I am living was saved out of tithe before the period of
582: commutation, and without the provisional transfiguration into a modus.
583: It has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of
584: excellent ham that, from a too tenable point of view, I was breakfasting
585: on a small squealing black pig which, more than half a century ago, was
586: the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise
587: acknowledged by the grudging farmer or dairyman who parted with him. One
588: enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward, and
589: such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham; but
590: since I have nevertheless eaten it, the chief effect has been to
591: moderate the severity of my radicalism (which was not part of my
592: paternal inheritance) and to raise the assuaging reflection, that if the
593: pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my
594: historical point of view, they would have seen themselves and the rector
595: in a light that would have made tithe voluntary. Notwithstanding such
596: drawbacks I am rather fond of the mental furniture I got by having a
597: father who was well acquainted with all ranks of his neighbours, and am
598: thankful that he was not one of those aristocratic clergymen who could
599: not have sat down to a meal with any family in the parish except my
600: lord's--still more that he was not an earl or a marquis. A chief
601: misfortune of high birth is that it usually shuts a man out from the
602: large sympathetic knowledge of human experience which comes from contact
603: with various classes on their own level, and in my father's time that
604: entail of social ignorance had not been disturbed as we see it now. To
605: look always from overhead at the crowd of one's fellow-men must be in
606: many ways incapacitating, even with the best will and intelligence. The
607: serious blunders it must lead to in the effort to manage them for their
608: good, one may see clearly by the mistaken ways people take of flattering
609: and enticing those whose associations are unlike their own. Hence I have
610: always thought that the most fortunate Britons are those whose
611: experience has given them a practical share in many aspects of the
612: national lot, who have lived long among the mixed commonalty, roughing
613: it with them under difficulties, knowing how their food tastes to them,
614: and getting acquainted with their notions and motives not by inference
615: from traditional types in literature or from philosophical theories, but
616: from daily fellowship and observation. Of course such experience is apt
617: to get antiquated, and my father might find himself much at a loss
618: amongst a mixed rural population of the present day; but he knew very
619: well what could be wisely expected from the miners, the weavers, the
620: field-labourers, and farmers of his own time--yes, and from the
621: aristocracy, for he had been brought up in close contact with them and
622: had been companion to a young nobleman who was deaf and dumb. "A
623: clergyman, lad," he used to say to me, "should feel in himself a bit of
624: every class;" and this theory had a felicitous agreement with his
625: inclination and practice, which certainly answered in making him beloved
626: by his parishioners. They grumbled at their obligations towards him; but
627: what then? It was natural to grumble at any demand for payment, tithe
628: included, but also natural for a rector to desire his tithe and look
629: well after the levying. A Christian pastor who did not mind about his
630: money was not an ideal prevalent among the rural minds of fat central
631: England, and might have seemed to introduce a dangerous laxity of
632: supposition about Christian laymen who happened to be creditors. My
633: father was none the less beloved because he was understood to be of a
634: saving disposition, and how could he save without getting his tithe? The
635: sight of him was not unwelcome at any door, and he was remarkable among
636: the clergy of his district for having no lasting feud with rich or poor
637: in his parish. I profited by his popularity, and for months after my
638: mother's death, when I was a little fellow of nine, I was taken care of
639: first at one homestead and then at another; a variety which I enjoyed
640: much more than my stay at the Hall, where there was a tutor. Afterwards
641: for several years I was my father's constant companion in his outdoor
642: business, riding by his side on my little pony and listening to the
643: lengthy dialogues he held with Darby or Joan, the one on the road or in
644: the fields, the other outside or inside her door. In my earliest
645: remembrance of him his hair was already grey, for I was his youngest as
646: well as his only surviving child; and it seemed to me that advanced age
647: was appropriate to a father, as indeed in all respects I considered him
648: a parent so much to my honour, that the mention of my relationship to
649: him was likely to secure me regard among those to whom I was otherwise a
650: stranger--my father's stories from his life including so many names of
651: distant persons that my imagination placed no limit to his
652: acquaintanceship. He was a pithy talker, and his sermons bore marks of
653: his own composition. It is true, they must have been already old when I
654: began to listen to them, and they were no more than a year's supply, so
655: that they recurred as regularly as the Collects. But though this system
656: has been much ridiculed, I am prepared to defend it as equally sound
657: with that of a liturgy; and even if my researches had shown me that some
658: of my father's yearly sermons had been copied out from the works of
659: elder divines, this would only have been another proof of his good
660: judgment. One may prefer fresh eggs though laid by a fowl of the meanest
661: understanding, but why fresh sermons?
662: 
663: Nor can I be sorry, though myself given to meditative if not active
664: innovation, that my father was a Tory who had not exactly a dislike to
665: innovators and dissenters, but a slight opinion of them as persons of
666: ill-founded self-confidence; whence my young ears gathered many details
667: concerning those who might perhaps have called themselves the more
668: advanced thinkers in our nearest market-town, tending to convince me
669: that their characters were quite as mixed as those of the thinkers
670: behind them. This circumstance of my rearing has at least delivered me
671: from certain mistakes of classification which I observe in many of my
672: superiors, who have apparently no affectionate memories of a goodness
673: mingled with what they now regard as outworn prejudices. Indeed, my
674: philosophical notions, such as they are, continually carry me back to
675: the time when the fitful gleams of a spring day used to show me my own
676: shadow as that of a small boy on a small pony, riding by the side of a
677: larger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy uplands which we used to
678: dignify with the name of hills, or along by-roads with broad grassy
679: borders and hedgerows reckless of utility, on our way to outlying
680: hamlets, whose groups of inhabitants were as distinctive to my
681: imagination as if they had belonged to different regions of the globe.
682: From these we sometimes rode onward to the adjoining parish, where also
683: my father officiated, for he was a pluralist, but--I hasten to add--on
684: the smallest scale; for his one extra living was a poor vicarage, with
685: hardly fifty parishioners, and its church would have made a very shabby
686: barn, the grey worm-eaten wood of its pews and pulpit, with their doors
687: only half hanging on the hinges, being exactly the colour of a lean
688: mouse which I once observed as an interesting member of the scant
689: congregation, and conjectured to be the identical church mouse I had
690: heard referred to as an example of extreme poverty; for I was a
691: precocious boy, and often reasoned after the fashion of my elders,
692: arguing that "Jack and Jill" were real personages in our parish, and
693: that if I could identify "Jack" I should find on him the marks of a
694: broken crown.
695: 
696: Sometimes when I am in a crowded London drawing-room (for I am a
697: town-bird now, acquainted with smoky eaves, and tasting Nature in the
698: parks) quick flights of memory take me back among my father's
699: parishioners while I am still conscious of elbowing men who wear the
700: same evening uniform as myself; and I presently begin to wonder what
701: varieties of history lie hidden under this monotony of aspect. Some of
702: them, perhaps, belong to families with many quarterings; but how many
703: "quarterings" of diverse contact with their fellow-countrymen enter into
704: their qualifications to be parliamentary leaders, professors of social
705: science, or journalistic guides of the popular mind? Not that I feel
706: myself a person made competent by experience; on the contrary, I argue
707: that since an observation of different ranks has still left me
708: practically a poor creature, what must be the condition of those who
709: object even to read about the life of other British classes than their
710: own? But of my elbowing neighbours with their crush hats, I usually
711: imagine that the most distinguished among them have probably had a far
712: more instructive journey into manhood than mine. Here, perhaps, is a
713: thought-worn physiognomy, seeming at the present moment to be classed as
714: a mere species of white cravat and swallow-tail, which may once, like
715: Faraday's, have shown itself in curiously dubious embryonic form leaning
716: against a cottage lintel in small corduroys, and hungrily eating a bit
717: of brown bread and bacon; _there_ is a pair of eyes, now too much
718: wearied by the gas-light of public assemblies, that once perhaps learned
719: to read their native England through the same alphabet as mine--not
720: within the boundaries of an ancestral park, never even being driven
721: through the county town five miles off, but--among the midland villages
722: and markets, along by the tree-studded hedgerows, and where the heavy
723: barges seem in the distance to float mysteriously among the rushes and
724: the feathered grass. Our vision, both real and ideal, has since then
725: been filled with far other scenes: among eternal snows and stupendous
726: sun-scorched monuments of departed empires; within the scent of the long
727: orange-groves; and where the temple of Neptune looks out over the
728: siren-haunted sea. But my eyes at least have kept their early
729: affectionate joy in our native landscape, which is one deep root of our
730: national life and language.
731: 
732: And I often smile at my consciousness that certain conservative
733: prepossessions have mingled themselves for me with the influences of our
734: midland scenery, from the tops of the elms down to the buttercups and
735: the little wayside vetches. Naturally enough. That part of my father's
736: prime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the
737: great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration
738: of all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of
739: France was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with
740: a mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half
741: Roman. Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their
742: own words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed
743: ten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were
744: willing to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep
745: their throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind
746: from our coasts. To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary
747: doctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the
748: scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which
749: could maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word
750: "Government" in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my
751: effective religion, in contrast with the word "rebel," which seemed to
752: carry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that
753: Satan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more
754: detailed inquiry. I gathered that our national troubles in the first two
755: decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our
756: administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution,
757: would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been
758: thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if,
759: for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very
760: modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard,
761: had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of "bad times" as a
762: name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them
763: that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's
764: England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having
765: good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for
766: emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I
767: looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in
768: my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for
769: the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent
770: robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had
771: more chance of being real. The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a
772: ragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to
773: the historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king
774: was alive and well, which made all the more difference because I had no
775: notion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had
776: been still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise
777: persons thought undesirable.
778: 
779: Certainly that elder England with its frankly saleable boroughs, so
780: cheap compared with the seats obtained under the reformed method, and
781: its boroughs kindly presented by noblemen desirous to encourage
782: gratitude; its prisons with a miscellaneous company of felons and
783: maniacs and without any supply of water; its bloated, idle charities;
784: its non-resident, jovial clergy; its militia-balloting; and above all,
785: its blank ignorance of what we, its posterity, should be thinking of
786: it,--has great differences from the England of to-day. Yet we discern a
787: strong family likeness. Is there any country which shows at once as much
788: stability and as much susceptibility to change as ours? Our national
789: life is like that scenery which I early learned to love, not subject to
790: great convulsions, but easily showing more or less delicate (sometimes
791: melancholy) effects from minor changes. Hence our midland plains have
792: never lost their familiar expression and conservative spirit for me;
793: yet at every other mile, since I first looked on them, some sign of
794: world-wide change, some new direction of human labour has wrought itself
795: into what one may call the speech of the landscape--in contrast with
796: those grander and vaster regions of the earth which keep an indifferent
797: aspect in the presence of men's toil and devices. What does it signify
798: that a lilliputian train passes over a viaduct amidst the abysses of the
799: Apennines, or that a caravan laden with a nation's offerings creeps
800: across the unresting sameness of the desert, or that a petty cloud of
801: steam sweeps for an instant over the face of an Egyptian colossus
802: immovably submitting to its slow burial beneath the sand? But our
803: woodlands and pastures, our hedge-parted corn-fields and meadows, our
804: bits of high common where we used to plant the windmills, our quiet
805: little rivers here and there fit to turn a mill-wheel, our villages
806: along the old coach-roads, are all easily alterable lineaments that seem
807: to make the face of our Motherland sympathetic with the laborious lives
808: of her children. She does not take their ploughs and waggons
809: contemptuously, but rather makes every hovel and every sheepfold, every
810: railed bridge or fallen tree-trunk an agreeably noticeable incident; not
811: a mere speck in the midst of unmeasured vastness, but a piece of our
812: social history in pictorial writing.
813: 
814: Our rural tracts--where no Babel-chimney scales the heavens--are without
815: mighty objects to fill the soul with the sense of an outer world
816: unconquerably aloof from our efforts. The wastes are playgrounds (and
817: let us try to keep them such for the children's children who will
818: inherit no other sort of demesne); the grasses and reeds nod to each
819: other over the river, but we have cut a canal close by; the very heights
820: laugh with corn in August or lift the plough-team against the sky in
821: September. Then comes a crowd of burly navvies with pickaxes and
822: barrows, and while hardly a wrinkle is made in the fading mother's face
823: or a new curve of health in the blooming girl's, the hills are cut
824: through or the breaches between them spanned, we choose our level and
825: the white steam-pennon flies along it.
826: 
827: But because our land shows this readiness to be changed, all signs of
828: permanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe: some of us,
829: at least, love the scanty relics of our forests, and are thankful if a
830: bush is left of the old hedgerow. A crumbling bit of wall where the
831: delicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hangs its light branches, or a bit of grey
832: thatch with patches of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of
833: grass-stems on its ridge, is a thing to visit. And then the tiled roof
834: of cottage and homestead, of the long cow-shed where generations of the
835: milky mothers have stood patiently, of the broad-shouldered barns where
836: the old-fashioned flail once made resonant music, while the watch-dog
837: barked at the timidly venturesome fowls making pecking raids on the
838: outflying grain--the roofs that have looked out from among the elms and
839: walnut-trees, or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stacks, or
840: below the square stone steeple, gathering their grey or ochre-tinted
841: lichens and their olive-green mosses under all ministries,--let us
842: praise the sober harmonies they give to our landscape, helping to unite
843: us pleasantly with the elder generations who tilled the soil for us
844: before we were born, and paid heavier and heavier taxes, with much
845: grumbling, but without that deepest root of corruption--the
846: self-indulgent despair which cuts down and consumes and never plants.
847: 
848: But I check myself. Perhaps this England of my affections is half
849: visionary--a dream in which things are connected according to my
850: well-fed, lazy mood, and not at all by the multitudinous links of
851: graver, sadder fact, such as belong everywhere to the story of human
852: labour. Well, well, the illusions that began for us when we were less
853: acquainted with evil have not lost their value when we discern them to
854: be illusions. They feed the ideal Better, and in loving them still, we
855: strengthen the precious habit of loving something not visibly, tangibly
856: existent, but a spiritual product of our visible tangible selves.
857: 
858: I cherish my childish loves--the memory of that warm little nest where
859: my affections were fledged. Since then I have learned to care for
860: foreign countries, for literatures foreign and ancient, for the life of
861: Continental towns dozing round old cathedrals, for the life of London,
862: half sleepless with eager thought and strife, with indigestion or with
863: hunger; and now my consciousness is chiefly of the busy, anxious
864: metropolitan sort. My system responds sensitively to the London
865: weather-signs, political, social, literary; and my bachelor's hearth is
866: imbedded where by much craning of head and neck I can catch sight of a
867: sycamore in the Square garden: I belong to the "Nation of London." Why?
868: There have been many voluntary exiles in the world, and probably in the
869: very first exodus of the patriarchal Aryans--for I am determined not to
870: fetch my examples from races whose talk is of uncles and no
871: fathers--some of those who sallied forth went for the sake of a loved
872: companionship, when they would willingly have kept sight of the familiar
873: plains, and of the hills to which they had first lifted up their eyes.

877: 
878: III.
879: 
880: 
881: HOW WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCH.
882: 
883: The serene and beneficent goddess Truth, like other deities whose
884: disposition has been too hastily inferred from that of the men who have
885: invoked them, can hardly be well pleased with much of the worship paid
886: to her even in this milder age, when the stake and the rack have ceased
887: to form part of her ritual. Some cruelties still pass for service done
888: in her honour: no thumb-screw is used, no iron boot, no scorching of
889: flesh; but plenty of controversial bruising, laceration, and even
890: lifelong maiming. Less than formerly; but so long as this sort of
891: truth-worship has the sanction of a public that can often understand
892: nothing in a controversy except personal sarcasm or slanderous ridicule,
893: it is likely to continue. The sufferings of its victims are often as
894: little regarded as those of the sacrificial pig offered in old time,
895: with what we now regard as a sad miscalculation of effects.
896: 
897: One such victim is my old acquaintance Merman.
898: 
899: Twenty years ago Merman was a young man of promise, a conveyancer with a
900: practice which had certainly budded, but, like Aaron's rod, seemed not
901: destined to proceed further in that marvellous activity. Meanwhile he
902: occupied himself in miscellaneous periodical writing and in a
903: multifarious study of moral and physical science. What chiefly attracted
904: him in all subjects were the vexed questions which have the advantage of
905: not admitting the decisive proof or disproof that renders many ingenious
906: arguments superannuated. Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition: he
907: put all his doubts, queries, and paradoxes deferentially, contended
908: without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the
909: personality of Homer, expressed himself civilly though firmly on the
910: origin of language, and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such
911: subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the so-called elementary
912: substances, his own total scepticism concerning Manetho's chronology, or
913: even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the
914: outbreak of revolutionary tendencies. Such flexibility was naturally
915: much helped by his amiable feeling towards woman, whose nervous system,
916: he was convinced, would not bear the continuous strain of difficult
917: topics; and also by his willingness to contribute a song whenever the
918: same desultory charmer proposed music. Indeed his tastes were domestic
919: enough to beguile him into marriage when his resources were still very
920: moderate and partly uncertain. His friends wished that so ingenious and
921: agreeable a fellow might have more prosperity than they ventured to hope
922: for him, their chief regret on his account being that he did not
923: concentrate his talent and leave off forming opinions on at least
924: half-a-dozen of the subjects over which he scattered his attention,
925: especially now that he had married a "nice little woman" (the generic
926: name for acquaintances' wives when they are not markedly disagreeable).
927: He could not, they observed, want all his various knowledge and Laputan
928: ideas for his periodical writing which brought him most of his bread,
929: and he would do well to use his talents in getting a speciality that
930: would fit him for a post. Perhaps these well-disposed persons were a
931: little rash in presuming that fitness for a post would be the surest
932: ground for getting it; and on the whole, in now looking back on their
933: wishes for Merman, their chief satisfaction must be that those wishes
934: did not contribute to the actual result.
935: 
936: For in an evil hour Merman did concentrate himself. He had for many
937: years taken into his interest the comparative history of the ancient
938: civilisations, but it had not preoccupied him so as to narrow his
939: generous attention to everything else. One sleepless night, however (his
940: wife has more than once narrated to me the details of an event memorable
941: to her as the beginning of sorrows), after spending some hours over the
942: epoch-making work of Grampus, a new idea seized him with regard to the
943: possible connection of certain symbolic monuments common to widely
944: scattered races. Merman started up in bed. The night was cold, and the
945: sudden withdrawal of warmth made his wife first dream of a snowball,
946: and then cry--
947: 
948: "What is the matter, Proteus?"
949: 
950: "A great matter, Julia. That fellow Grampus, whose book is cried up as a
951: revelation, is all wrong about the Magicodumbras and the Zuzumotzis, and
952: I have got hold of the right clue."
953: 
954: "Good gracious! does it matter so much? Don't drag the clothes, dear."
955: 
956: "It signifies this, Julia, that if I am right I shall set the world
957: right; I shall regenerate history; I shall win the mind of Europe to a
958: new view of social origins; I shall bruise the head of many
959: superstitions."
960: 
961: "Oh no, dear, don't go too far into things. Lie down again. You have
962: been dreaming. What are the Madicojumbras and Zuzitotzums? I never heard
963: you talk of them before. What use can it be troubling yourself about
964: such things?"
965: 
966: "That is the way, Julia--that is the way wives alienate their husbands,
967: and make any hearth pleasanter to him than his own!"
968: 
969: "What _do_ you mean, Proteus?"
970: 
971: "Why, if a woman will not try to understand her husband's ideas, or at
972: least to believe that they are of more value than she can understand--if
973: she is to join anybody who happens to be against him, and suppose he is
974: a fool because others contradict him--there is an end of our happiness.
975: That is all I have to say."
976: 
977: "Oh no, Proteus, dear. I do believe what you say is right. That is my
978: only guide. I am sure I never have any opinions in any other way: I mean
979: about subjects. Of course there are many little things that would tease
980: you, that you like me to judge of for myself. I know I said once that I
981: did not want you to sing 'Oh ruddier than the cherry,' because it was
982: not in your voice. But I cannot remember ever differing from you about
983: _subjects_. I never in my life thought any one cleverer than you."
984: 
985: Julia Merman was really a "nice little woman," not one of the stately
986: Dians sometimes spoken of in those terms. Her black _silhouette_ had a
987: very infantine aspect, but she had discernment and wisdom enough to act
988: on the strong hint of that memorable conversation, never again giving
989: her husband the slightest ground for suspecting that she thought
990: treasonably of his ideas in relation to the Magicodumbras and
991: Zuzumotzis, or in the least relaxed her faith in his infallibility
992: because Europe was not also convinced of it. It was well for her that
993: she did not increase her troubles in this way; but to do her justice,
994: what she was chiefly anxious about was to avoid increasing her husband's
995: troubles.
996: 
997: Not that these were great in the beginning. In the first development and
998: writing out of his scheme, Merman had a more intense kind of
999: intellectual pleasure than he had ever known before. His face became
1000: more radiant, his general view of human prospects more cheerful.
1001: Foreseeing that truth as presented by himself would win the recognition
1002: of his contemporaries, he excused with much liberality their rather
1003: rough treatment of other theorists whose basis was less perfect. His own
1004: periodical criticisms had never before been so amiable: he was sorry for
1005: that unlucky majority whom the spirit of the age, or some other
1006: prompting more definite and local, compelled to write without any
1007: particular ideas. The possession of an original theory which has not yet
1008: been assailed must certainly sweeten the temper of a man who is not
1009: beforehand ill-natured. And Merman was the reverse of ill-natured.
1010: 
1011: But the hour of publication came; and to half-a-dozen persons, described
1012: as the learned world of two hemispheres, it became known that Grampus
1013: was attacked. This might have been a small matter; for who or what on
1014: earth that is good for anything is not assailed by ignorance, stupidity,
1015: or malice--and sometimes even by just objection? But on examination it
1016: appeared that the attack might possibly be held damaging, unless the
1017: ignorance of the author were well exposed and his pretended facts shown
1018: to be chimeras of that remarkably hideous kind begotten by imperfect
1019: learning on the more feminine element of original incapacity. Grampus
1020: himself did not immediately cut open the volume which Merman had been
1021: careful to send him, not without a very lively and shifting conception
1022: of the possible effects which the explosive gift might produce on the
1023: too eminent scholar--effects that must certainly have set in on the
1024: third day from the despatch of the parcel. But in point of fact Grampus
1025: knew nothing of the book until his friend Lord Narwhal sent him an
1026: American newspaper containing a spirited article by the well-known
1027: Professor Sperm N. Whale which was rather equivocal in its bearing, the
1028: passages quoted from Merman being of rather a telling sort, and the
1029: paragraphs which seemed to blow defiance being unaccountably feeble,
1030: coming from so distinguished a Cetacean. Then, by another post, arrived
1031: letters from Butzkopf and Dugong, both men whose signatures were
1032: familiar to the Teutonic world in the _Selten-erscheinende
1033: Monat-schrift_ or Hayrick for the insertion of Split Hairs, asking their
1034: Master whether he meant to take up the combat, because, in the contrary
1035: case, both were ready.
1036: 
1037: Thus America and Germany were roused, though England was still drowsy,
1038: and it seemed time now for Grampus to find Merman's book under the heap
1039: and cut it open. For his own part he was perfectly at ease about his
1040: system; but this is a world in which the truth requires defence, and
1041: specious falsehood must be met with exposure. Grampus having once looked
1042: through the book, no longer wanted any urging to write the most crushing
1043: of replies. This, and nothing less than this, was due from him to the
1044: cause of sound inquiry; and the punishment would cost him little pains.
1045: In three weeks from that time the palpitating Merman saw his book
1046: announced in the programme of the leading Review. No need for Grampus to
1047: put his signature. Who else had his vast yet microscopic knowledge, who
1048: else his power of epithet? This article in which Merman was pilloried
1049: and as good as mutilated--for he was shown to have neither ear nor nose
1050: for the subtleties of philological and archaeological study--was much
1051: read and more talked of, not because of any interest in the system of
1052: Grampus, or any precise conception of the danger attending lax views of
1053: the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, but because the sharp epigrams with
1054: which the victim was lacerated, and the soaring fountains of acrid mud
1055: which were shot upward and poured over the fresh wounds, were found
1056: amusing in recital. A favourite passage was one in which a certain kind
1057: of sciolist was described as a creature of the Walrus kind, having a
1058: phantasmal resemblance to higher animals when seen by ignorant minds in
1059: the twilight, dabbling or hobbling in first one element and then the
1060: other, without parts or organs suited to either, in fact one of Nature's
1061: impostors who could not be said to have any artful pretences, since a
1062: congenital incompetence to all precision of aim and movement made their
1063: every action a pretence--just as a being born in doeskin gloves would
1064: necessarily pass a judgment on surfaces, but we all know what his
1065: judgment would be worth. In drawing-room circles, and for the immediate
1066: hour, this ingenious comparison was as damaging as the showing up of
1067: Merman's mistakes and the mere smattering of linguistic and historical
1068: knowledge which he had presumed to be a sufficient basis for theorising;
1069: but the more learned cited his blunders aside to each other and laughed
1070: the laugh of the initiated. In fact, Merman's was a remarkable case of
1071: sudden notoriety. In London drums and clubs he was spoken of abundantly
1072: as one who had written ridiculously about the Magicodumbras and
1073: Zuzumotzis: the leaders of conversation, whether Christians, Jews,
1074: infidels, or of any other confession except the confession of ignorance,
1075: pronouncing him shallow and indiscreet if not presumptuous and absurd.
1076: He was heard of at Warsaw, and even Paris took knowledge of him. M.
1077: Cachalot had not read either Grampus or Merman, but he heard of their
1078: dispute in time to insert a paragraph upon it in his brilliant work,
1079: _L'orient au point de vue actuel_, in which he was dispassionate enough
1080: to speak of Grampus as possessing a _coup d'oeil presque français_ in
1081: matters of historical interpretation, and of Merman as nevertheless an
1082: objector _qui mérite d'être connu_. M. Porpesse, also, availing himself
1083: of M. Cachalot's knowledge, reproduced it in an article with certain
1084: additions, which it is only fair to distinguish as his own, implying
1085: that the vigorous English of Grampus was not always as correct as a
1086: Frenchman could desire, while Merman's objections were more sophistical
1087: than solid. Presently, indeed, there appeared an able _extrait_ of
1088: Grampus's article in the valuable _Rapporteur scientifique et
1089: historique_, and Merman's mistakes were thus brought under the notice of
1090: certain Frenchmen who are among the masters of those who know on
1091: oriental subjects. In a word, Merman, though not extensively read, was
1092: extensively read about.
1093: 
1094: Meanwhile, how did he like it? Perhaps nobody, except his wife, for a
1095: moment reflected on that. An amused society considered that he was
1096: severely punished, but did not take the trouble to imagine his
1097: sensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less
1098: sensitive and excitable than Merman himself. Perhaps that popular
1099: comparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on
1100: thorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it.
1101: But it is well known that the walrus, though not in the least a
1102: malignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and
1103: blundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes
1104: desperately savage and musters alarming auxiliaries when attacked or
1105: hurt. In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus. And
1106: now he concentrated himself with a vengeance. That his counter-theory
1107: was fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever
1108: collateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not
1109: cease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that
1110: Grampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide
1111: sophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to
1112: clear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras
1113: and Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide
1114: survey of history and a diversified observation of men. Still, Merman
1115: was resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he
1116: wandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he
1117: tried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to
1118: speak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones,
1119: for the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or
1120: possibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering.
1121: All other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed
1122: editors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting
1123: book-parcels from them. It was many months before Merman had satisfied
1124: himself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary. But
1125: at last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which
1126: seemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial
1127: writing. He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory
1128: so as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even
1129: found cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and
1130: other Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with
1131: Grampus. Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of
1132: fossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three
1133: different interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who
1134: took the words in their most literal sense; for, 1°, the incomparable
1135: Saurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing
1136: comprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2°, _motzis_
1137: was probably a false reading for _potzis_, in which case its bearing was
1138: reversed; and 3°, it is known that in the age of the Saurians there
1139: were conceptions about the _motzis_ which entirely remove it from the
1140: category of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run
1141: ridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit
1142: to be ranked with that of Grampus. In fine, Merman wound up his
1143: rejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose
1144: fierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of
1145: which he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own
1146: fundamental views. Evidently Merman's anger was at white heat.
1147: 
1148: The rejoinder being complete, all that remained was to find a suitable
1149: medium for its publication. This was not so easy. Distinguished mediums
1150: would not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they
1151: would, Merman's article was too long and too abstruse, while he would
1152: not consent to leave anything out of an article which had no
1153: superfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a
1154: different stage. At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not
1155: on hard terms, since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him
1156: to pay for its insertion.
1157: 
1158: But if Merman expected to call out Grampus again, he was mistaken.
1159: Everybody felt it too absurd that Merman should undertake to correct
1160: Grampus in matters of erudition, and an eminent man has something else
1161: to do than to refute a petty objector twice over. What was essential had
1162: been done: the public had been enabled to form a true judgment of
1163: Merman's incapacity, the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis were but
1164: subsidiary elements in Grampus's system, and Merman might now be dealt
1165: with by younger members of the master's school. But he had at least the
1166: satisfaction of finding that he had raised a discussion which would not
1167: be let die. The followers of Grampus took it up with an ardour and
1168: industry of research worthy of their exemplar. Butzkopf made it the
1169: subject of an elaborate _Einleitung_ to his important work, _Die
1170: Bedeutung des Aegyptischen Labyrinthes_; and Dugong, in a remarkable
1171: address which he delivered to a learned society in Central Europe,
1172: introduced Merman's theory with so much power of sarcasm that it became
1173: a theme of more or less derisive allusion to men of many tongues. Merman
1174: with his Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis was on the way to become a
1175: proverb, being used illustratively by many able journalists who took
1176: those names of questionable things to be Merman's own invention, "than
1177: which," said one of the graver guides, "we can recall few more
1178: melancholy examples of speculative aberration." Naturally the subject
1179: passed into popular literature, and figured very commonly in advertised
1180: programmes. The fluent Loligo, the formidable Shark, and a younger
1181: member of his remarkable family known as S. Catulus, made a special
1182: reputation by their numerous articles, eloquent, lively, or abusive, all
1183: on the same theme, under titles ingeniously varied, alliterative,
1184: sonorous, or boldly fanciful; such as, "Moments with Mr Merman," "Mr
1185: Merman and the Magicodumbras," "Greenland Grampus and Proteus Merman,"
1186: "Grampian Heights and their Climbers, or the New Excelsior." They tossed
1187: him on short sentences; they swathed him in paragraphs of winding
1188: imagery; they found him at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of
1189: unexampled perversity, ridiculously wrong about _potzis_ and ignorant of
1190: Pali; they hinted, indeed, at certain things which to their knowledge he
1191: had silently brooded over in his boyhood, and seemed tolerably well
1192: assured that this preposterous attempt to gainsay an incomparable
1193: Cetacean of world-wide fame had its origin in a peculiar mixture of
1194: bitterness and eccentricity which, rightly estimated and seen in its
1195: definite proportions, would furnish the best key to his argumentation.
1196: All alike were sorry for Merman's lack of sound learning, but how could
1197: their readers be sorry? Sound learning would not have been amusing; and
1198: as it was, Merman was made to furnish these readers with amusement at no
1199: expense of trouble on their part. Even burlesque writers looked into his
1200: book to see where it could be made use of, and those who did not know
1201: him were desirous of meeting him at dinner as one likely to feed their
1202: comic vein.
1203: 
1204: On the other hand, he made a serious figure in sermons under the name of
1205: "Some" or "Others" who had attempted presumptuously to scale eminences
1206: too high and arduous for human ability, and had given an example of
1207: ignominious failure edifying to the humble Christian.
1208: 
1209: All this might be very advantageous for able persons whose superfluous
1210: fund of expression needed a paying investment, but the effect on Merman
1211: himself was unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking
1212: of which he had become the occasion. His certainty that he was right
1213: naturally got stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance was
1214: stimulated. The scorn and unfairness with which he felt himself to have
1215: been treated by those really competent to appreciate his ideas had
1216: galled him and made a chronic sore; and the exultant chorus of the
1217: incompetent seemed a pouring of vinegar on his wound. His brain became a
1218: registry of the foolish and ignorant objections made against him, and of
1219: continually amplified answers to these objections. Unable to get his
1220: answers printed, he had recourse to that more primitive mode of
1221: publication, oral transmission or button-holding, now generally regarded
1222: as a troublesome survival, and the once pleasant, flexible Merman was on
1223: the way to be shunned as a bore. His interest in new acquaintances
1224: turned chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the
1225: Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis; that they would listen to his complaints
1226: and exposures of unfairness, and not only accept copies of what he had
1227: written on the subject, but send him appreciative letters in
1228: acknowledgment. Repeated disappointment of such hopes tended to embitter
1229: him, and not the less because after a while the fashion of mentioning
1230: him died out, allusions to his theory were less understood, and people
1231: could only pretend to remember it. And all the while Merman was
1232: perfectly sure that his very opponents who had knowledge enough to be
1233: capable judges were aware that his book, whatever errors of statement
1234: they might detect in it, had served as a sort of divining rod, pointing
1235: out hidden sources of historical interpretation; nay, his jealous
1236: examination discerned in a new work by Grampus himself a certain
1237: shifting of ground which--so poor Merman declared--was the sign of an
1238: intention gradually to appropriate the views of the man he had attempted
1239: to brand as an ignorant impostor.
1240: 
1241: And Julia? And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which
1242: controversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serves as a
1243: recommendation to certain posts. Controversial pamphlets have been known
1244: to earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from
1245: unpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis. Painfully
1246: the contrary. Merman's reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a
1247: sound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy
1248: had caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his
1249: dwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too
1250: dull to be desirable. Even if he could now have given a new turn to his
1251: concentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself
1252: an exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an
1253: architect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not
1254: have had an opportunity of showing his qualification. He was thrown out
1255: of the course. The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of
1256: income was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies
1257: equal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants. The
1258: brave and affectionate woman whose small outline, so unimpressive
1259: against an illuminated background, held within it a good share of
1260: feminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe
1261: her husband's excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding
1262: presents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that
1263: this sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only
1264: laughed at him. She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that
1265: some husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only
1266: taken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a
1267: little more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever
1268: expected he would be, his mind being eaten up with "subjects," and
1269: constantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else,
1270: especially those who were celebrated.
1271: 
1272: This was the sad truth. Merman felt himself ill-used by the world, and
1273: thought very much worse of the world in consequence. The gall of his
1274: adversaries' ink had been sucked into his system and ran in his blood.
1275: He was still in the prime of life, but his mind was aged by that eager
1276: monotonous construction which comes of feverish excitement on a single
1277: topic and uses up the intellectual strength.
1278: 
1279: Merman had never been a rich man, but he was now conspicuously poor, and
1280: in need of the friends who had power or interest which he believed they
1281: could exert on his behalf. Their omitting or declining to give this help
1282: could not seem to him so clearly as to them an inevitable consequence of
1283: his having become impracticable, or at least of his passing for a man
1284: whose views were not likely to be safe and sober. Each friend in turn
1285: offended him, though unwillingly, and was suspected of wishing to shake
1286: him off. It was not altogether so; but poor Merman's society had
1287: undeniably ceased to be attractive, and it was difficult to help him. At
1288: last the pressure of want urged him to try for a post far beneath his
1289: earlier prospects, and he gained it. He holds it still, for he has no
1290: vices, and his domestic life has kept up a sweetening current of motive
1291: around and within him. Nevertheless, the bitter flavour mingling itself
1292: with all topics, the premature weariness and withering, are irrevocably
1293: there. It is as if he had gone through a disease which alters what we
1294: call the constitution. He has long ceased to talk eagerly of the ideas
1295: which possess him, or to attempt making proselytes. The dial has moved
1296: onward, and he himself sees many of his former guesses in a new light.
1297: On the other hand, he has seen what he foreboded, that the main idea
1298: which was at the root of his too rash theorising has been adopted by
1299: Grampus and received with general respect, no reference being heard to
1300: the ridiculous figure this important conception made when ushered in by
1301: the incompetent "Others."
1302: 
1303: Now and then, on rare occasions, when a sympathetic _tête-à-tête_ has
1304: restored some of his old expansiveness, he will tell a companion in a
1305: railway carriage, or other place of meeting favourable to
1306: autobiographical confidences, what has been the course of things in his
1307: particular case, as an example of the justice to be expected of the
1308: world. The companion usually allows for the bitterness of a disappointed
1309: man, and is secretly disinclined to believe that Grampus was to blame.
1310:

1312: 
1313: 
1314: IV.
1315: 
1316: 
1317: A MAN SURPRISED AT HIS ORIGINALITY.
1318: 
1319: Among the many acute sayings of La Rochefoucauld, there is hardly one
1320: more acute than this: "La plus grande ambition n'en a pas la moindre
1321: apparence lorsqu'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilité absolue
1322: d'arriver où elle aspire." Some of us might do well to use this hint in
1323: our treatment of acquaintances and friends from whom we are expecting
1324: gratitude because we are so very kind in thinking of them, inviting
1325: them, and even listening to what they say--considering how insignificant
1326: they must feel themselves to be. We are often fallaciously confident in
1327: supposing that our friend's state of mind is appropriate to our moderate
1328: estimate of his importance: almost as if we imagined the humble mollusc
1329: (so useful as an illustration) to have a sense of his own exceeding
1330: softness and low place in the scale of being. Your mollusc, on the
1331: contrary, is inwardly objecting to every other grade of solid rather
1332: than to himself. Accustomed to observe what we think an unwarrantable
1333: conceit exhibiting itself in ridiculous pretensions and forwardness to
1334: play the lion's part, in obvious self-complacency and loud
1335: peremptoriness, we are not on the alert to detect the egoistic claims of
1336: a more exorbitant kind often hidden under an apparent neutrality or an
1337: acquiescence in being put out of the question.
1338: 
1339: Thoughts of this kind occurred to me yesterday when I saw the name of
1340: Lentulus in the obituary. The majority of his acquaintances, I imagine,
1341: have always thought of him as a man justly unpretending and as nobody's
1342: rival; but some of them have perhaps been struck with surprise at his
1343: reserve in praising the works of his contemporaries, and have now and
1344: then felt themselves in need of a key to his remarks on men of celebrity
1345: in various departments. He was a man of fair position, deriving his
1346: income from a business in which he did nothing, at leisure to frequent
1347: clubs and at ease in giving dinners; well-looking, polite, and generally
1348: acceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb--the
1349: neutral basis needful for the plums and spice. Why, then, did he speak
1350: of the modern Maro or the modern Flaccus with a peculiarity in his tone
1351: of assent to other people's praise which might almost have led you to
1352: suppose that the eminent poet had borrowed money of him and showed an
1353: indisposition to repay? He had no criticism to offer, no sign of
1354: objection more specific than a slight cough, a scarcely perceptible
1355: pause before assenting, and an air of self-control in his utterance--as
1356: if certain considerations had determined him not to inform against the
1357: so-called poet, who to his knowledge was a mere versifier. If you had
1358: questioned him closely, he would perhaps have confessed that he did
1359: think something better might be done in the way of Eclogues and
1360: Georgics, or of Odes and Epodes, and that to his mind poetry was
1361: something very different from what had hitherto been known under that
1362: name.
1363: 
1364: For my own part, being of a superstitious nature, given readily to
1365: imagine alarming causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic
1366: hints from Lentulus, concluded that he held a number of entirely
1367: original poems, or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on
1368: poetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling
1369: all that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid
1370: in speaking of the poets when he was present. For what might not
1371: Lentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my
1372: ignorant impressions ridiculous? One cannot well be sure of the negative
1373: in such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to
1374: it; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of. But time
1375: wearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the
1376: philosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets;
1377: nay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his
1378: mouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt
1379: consciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all
1380: thinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own
1381: power of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I
1382: began to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line
1383: of Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in
1384: systematic construction. In this case I did not figure to myself the
1385: existence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great
1386: thinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds
1387: long before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new
1388: passion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously
1389: unwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive selves,
1390: until the locks are grey or scanty. I only meditated improvingly on the
1391: way in which a man of exceptional faculties, and even carrying within
1392: him some of that fierce refiner's fire which is to purge away the dross
1393: of human error, may move about in society totally unrecognised, regarded
1394: as a person whose opinion is superfluous, and only rising into a power
1395: in emergencies of threatened black-balling. Imagine a Descartes or a
1396: Locke being recognised for nothing more than a good fellow and a
1397: perfect gentleman--what a painful view does such a picture suggest of
1398: impenetrable dulness in the society around them!
1399: 
1400: I would at all times rather be reduced to a cheaper estimate of a
1401: particular person, if by that means I can get a more cheerful view of my
1402: fellow-men generally; and I confess that in a certain curiosity which
1403: led me to cultivate Lentulus's acquaintance, my hope leaned to the
1404: discovery that he was a less remarkable man than he had seemed to imply.
1405: It would have been a grief to discover that he was bitter or malicious,
1406: but by finding him to be neither a mighty poet, nor a revolutionary
1407: poetical critic, nor an epoch-making philosopher, my admiration for the
1408: poets and thinkers whom he rated so low would recover all its buoyancy,
1409: and I should not be left to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit
1410: which constitutes an exception in the history of mankind, and recommends
1411: itself as the total abolitionist of all previous claims on our
1412: confidence. You are not greatly surprised at the infirm logic of the
1413: coachman who would persuade you to engage him by insisting that any
1414: other would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn, thus
1415: demanding a difficult belief in him as the sole exception from the
1416: frailties of his calling; but it is rather astonishing that the
1417: wholesale decriers of mankind and its performances should be even more
1418: unwary in their reasoning than the coachman, since each of them not
1419: merely confides in your regarding himself as an exception, but overlooks
1420: the almost certain fact that you are wondering whether he inwardly
1421: excepts _you_. Now, conscious of entertaining some common opinions which
1422: seemed to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of Lentulus,
1423: my self-complacency was a little concerned.
1424: 
1425: Hence I deliberately attempted to draw out Lentulus in private dialogue,
1426: for it is the reverse of injury to a man to offer him that hearing which
1427: he seems to have found nowhere else. And for whatever purposes silence
1428: may be equal to gold, it cannot be safely taken as an indication of
1429: specific ideas. I sought to know why Lentulus was more than indifferent
1430: to the poets, and what was that new poetry which he had either written
1431: or, as to its principles, distinctly conceived. But I presently found
1432: that he knew very little of any particular poet, and had a general
1433: notion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal
1434: sentiments: he instanced "The Giaour," "Lalla Rookh," "The Pleasures of
1435: Hope," and "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King;" adding, "and plenty more."
1436: On my observing that he probably preferred a larger, simpler style, he
1437: emphatically assented. "Have you not," said I, "written something of
1438: that order?" "No; but I often compose as I go along. I see how things
1439: might be written as fine as Ossian, only with true ideas. The world has
1440: no notion what poetry will be."
1441: 
1442: It was impossible to disprove this, and I am always glad to believe that
1443: the poverty of our imagination is no measure of the world's resources.
1444: Our posterity will no doubt get fuel in ways that we are unable to
1445: devise for them. But what this conversation persuaded me of was, that
1446: the birth with which the mind of Lentulus was pregnant could not be
1447: poetry, though I did not question that he composed as he went along, and
1448: that the exercise was accompanied with a great sense of power. This is a
1449: frequent experience in dreams, and much of our waking experience is but
1450: a dream in the daylight. Nay, for what I saw, the compositions might be
1451: fairly classed as Ossianic. But I was satisfied that Lentulus could not
1452: disturb my grateful admiration for the poets of all ages by eclipsing
1453: them, or by putting them under a new electric light of criticism.
1454: 
1455: Still, he had himself thrown the chief emphasis of his protest and his
1456: consciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of
1457: our race; and his tone in assuring me that everything which had been
1458: done in that way was wrong--that Plato, Robert Owen, and Dr Tuffle who
1459: wrote in the 'Regulator,' were all equally mistaken--gave my
1460: superstitious nature a thrill of anxiety. After what had passed about
1461: the poets, it did not seem likely that Lentulus had all systems by
1462: heart; but who could say he had not seized that thread which may
1463: somewhere hang out loosely from the web of things and be the clue of
1464: unravelment? We need not go far to learn that a prophet is not made by
1465: erudition. Lentulus at least had not the bias of a school; and if it
1466: turned out that he was in agreement with any celebrated thinker,
1467: ancient or modern, the agreement would have the value of an undesigned
1468: coincidence not due to forgotten reading. It was therefore with renewed
1469: curiosity that I engaged him on this large subject--the universal
1470: erroneousness of thinking up to the period when Lentulus began that
1471: process. And here I found him more copious than on the theme of poetry.
1472: He admitted that he did contemplate writing down his thoughts, but his
1473: difficulty was their abundance. Apparently he was like the woodcutter
1474: entering the thick forest and saying, "Where shall I begin?" The same
1475: obstacle appeared in a minor degree to cling about his verbal
1476: exposition, and accounted perhaps for his rather helter-skelter choice
1477: of remarks bearing on the number of unaddressed letters sent to the
1478: post-office; on what logic really is, as tending to support the buoyancy
1479: of human mediums and mahogany tables; on the probability of all miracles
1480: under all religions when explained by hidden laws, and my
1481: unreasonableness in supposing that their profuse occurrence at half a
1482: guinea an hour in recent times was anything more than a coincidence; on
1483: the haphazard way in which marriages are determined--showing the
1484: baselessness of social and moral schemes; and on his expectation that he
1485: should offend the scientific world when he told them what he thought of
1486: electricity as an agent.
1487: 
1488: No man's appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of
1489: Lentulus as we walked along the Mall while he delivered these
1490: observations, understood by himself to have a regenerative bearing on
1491: human society. His wristbands and black gloves, his hat and nicely
1492: clipped hair, his laudable moderation in beard, and his evident
1493: discrimination in choosing his tailor, all seemed to excuse the
1494: prevalent estimate of him as a man untainted with heterodoxy, and likely
1495: to be so unencumbered with opinions that he would always be useful as an
1496: assenting and admiring listener. Men of science seeing him at their
1497: lectures doubtless flattered themselves that he came to learn from them;
1498: the philosophic ornaments of our time, expounding some of their luminous
1499: ideas in the social circle, took the meditative gaze of Lentulus for one
1500: of surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning
1501: towards so novel a conclusion; and those who are called men of the
1502: world considered him a good fellow who might be asked to vote for a
1503: friend of their own and would have no troublesome notions to make him
1504: unaccommodating. You perceive how very much they were all mistaken,
1505: except in qualifying him as a good fellow.
1506: 
1507: This Lentulus certainly was, in the sense of being free from envy,
1508: hatred, and malice; and such freedom was all the more remarkable an
1509: indication of native benignity, because of his gaseous, illimitably
1510: expansive conceit. Yes, conceit; for that his enormous and contentedly
1511: ignorant confidence in his own rambling thoughts was usually clad in a
1512: decent silence, is no reason why it should be less strictly called by
1513: the name directly implying a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by
1514: performance. Nay, the total privacy in which he enjoyed his
1515: consciousness of inspiration was the very condition of its undisturbed
1516: placid nourishment and gigantic growth. Your audibly arrogant man
1517: exposes himself to tests: in attempting to make an impression on others
1518: he may possibly (not always) be made to feel his own lack of
1519: definiteness; and the demand for definiteness is to all of us a needful
1520: check on vague depreciation of what others do, and vague ecstatic trust
1521: in our own superior ability. But Lentulus was at once so unreceptive,
1522: and so little gifted with the power of displaying his miscellaneous
1523: deficiency of information, that there was really nothing to hinder his
1524: astonishment at the spontaneous crop of ideas which his mind secretly
1525: yielded. If it occurred to him that there were more meanings than one
1526: for the word "motive," since it sometimes meant the end aimed at and
1527: sometimes the feeling that prompted the aiming, and that the word
1528: "cause" was also of changeable import, he was naturally struck with the
1529: truth of his own perception, and was convinced that if this vein were
1530: well followed out much might be made of it. Men were evidently in the
1531: wrong about cause and effect, else why was society in the confused state
1532: we behold? And as to motive, Lentulus felt that when he came to write
1533: down his views he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show
1534: up thereby the anomalies of our social institutions; meanwhile the
1535: various aspects of "motive" and "cause" flitted about among the motley
1536: crowd of ideas which he regarded as original, and pregnant with
1537: reformative efficacy. For his unaffected goodwill made him regard all
1538: his insight as only valuable because it tended towards reform.
1539: 
1540: The respectable man had got into his illusory maze of discoveries by
1541: letting go that clue of conformity in his thinking which he had kept
1542: fast hold of in his tailoring and manners. He regarded heterodoxy as a
1543: power in itself, and took his inacquaintance with doctrines for a
1544: creative dissidence. But his epitaph needs not to be a melancholy one.
1545: His benevolent disposition was more effective for good than his silent
1546: presumption for harm. He might have been mischievous but for the lack of
1547: words: instead of being astonished at his inspirations in private, he
1548: might have clad his addled originalities, disjointed commonplaces, blind
1549: denials, and balloon-like conclusions, in that mighty sort of language
1550: which would have made a new Koran for a knot of followers. I mean no
1551: disrespect to the ancient Koran, but one would not desire the roc to lay
1552: more eggs and give us a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make
1553: twilight.
1554: 
1555: Peace be with Lentulus, for he has left us in peace. Blessed is the man
1556: who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of
1557: the fact--from calling on us to look through a heap of millet-seed in
1558: order to be sure that there is no pearl in it.
1559: 
1560: 
1561: 
1562: 
1563: V.
1564: 
1565: 
1566: A TOO DEFERENTIAL MAN.
1567: 
1568: A little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulged under the stress of
1569: social intercourse. The talk even of an honest man must often represent
1570: merely his wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than his genuine
1571: opinion or feeling on the matter in hand. His thought, if uttered, might
1572: be wounding; or he has not the ability to utter it with exactness and
1573: snatches at a loose paraphrase; or he has really no genuine thought on
1574: the question and is driven to fill up the vacancy by borrowing the
1575: remarks in vogue. These are the winds and currents we have all to steer
1576: amongst, and they are often too strong for our truthfulness or our wit.
1577: Let us not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental
1578: frailty, or think that we rise superior to it by dropping all
1579: considerateness and deference.
1580: 
1581: But there are studious, deliberate forms of insincerity which it is fair
1582: to be impatient with: Hinze's, for example. From his name you might
1583: suppose him to be German: in fact, his family is Alsatian, but has been
1584: settled in England for more than one generation. He is the superlatively
1585: deferential man, and walks about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and
1586: discernment of everybody who talks to him. He cultivates the low-toned
1587: _tête-à-tête,_ keeping his hat carefully in his hand and often stroking
1588: it, while he smiles with downcast eyes, as if to relieve his feelings
1589: under the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it is his honour
1590: to enjoy at the present moment. I confess to some rage on hearing him
1591: yesterday talking to Felicia, who is certainly a clever woman, and,
1592: without any unusual desire to show her cleverness, occasionally says
1593: something of her own or makes an allusion which is not quite common.
1594: Still, it must happen to her as to every one else to speak of many
1595: subjects on which the best things were said long ago, and in
1596: conversation with a person who has been newly introduced those
1597: well-worn themes naturally recur as a further development of salutations
1598: and preliminary media of understanding, such as pipes, chocolate, or
1599: mastic-chewing, which serve to confirm the impression that our new
1600: acquaintance is on a civilised footing and has enough regard for
1601: formulas to save us from shocking outbursts of individualism, to which
1602: we are always exposed with the tamest bear or baboon. Considered purely
1603: as a matter of information, it cannot any longer be important for us to
1604: learn that a British subject included in the last census holds Shakspere
1605: to be supreme in the presentation of character; still, it is as
1606: admissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub
1607: his hands and tell you that the air is brisk, if only he will let it
1608: fall as a matter of course, with a parenthetic lightness, and not
1609: announce his adhesion to a commonplace with an emphatic insistance, as
1610: if it were a proof of singular insight. We mortals should chiefly like
1611: to talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship, not for the sake
1612: of hearing revelations or being stimulated by witticisms; and I have
1613: usually found that it is the rather dull person who appears to be
1614: disgusted with his contemporaries because they are not always strikingly
1615: original, and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have
1616: included the prophet Isaiah, Plato, Francis Bacon, and Voltaire. It is
1617: always your heaviest bore who is astonished at the tameness of modern
1618: celebrities: naturally; for a little of his company has reduced them to
1619: a state of flaccid fatigue. It is right and meet that there should be an
1620: abundant utterance of good sound commonplaces. Part of an agreeable
1621: talker's charm is that he lets them fall continually with no more than
1622: their due emphasis. Giving a pleasant voice to what we are all well
1623: assured of, makes a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious
1624: remark to move in.
1625: 
1626: Hence it seemed to me far from unbecoming in Felicia that in her first
1627: dialogue with Hinze, previously quite a stranger to her, her
1628: observations were those of an ordinarily refined and well-educated woman
1629: on standard subjects, and might have been printed in a manual of polite
1630: topics and creditable opinions. She had no desire to astonish a man of
1631: whom she had heard nothing particular. It was all the more exasperating
1632: to see and hear Hinze's reception of her well-bred conformities.
1633: Felicia's acquaintances know her as the suitable wife of a distinguished
1634: man, a sensible, vivacious, kindly-disposed woman, helping her husband
1635: with graceful apologies written and spoken, and making her receptions
1636: agreeable to all comers. But you would have imagined that Hinze had been
1637: prepared by general report to regard this introduction to her as an
1638: opportunity comparable to an audience of the Delphic Sibyl. When she had
1639: delivered herself on the changes in Italian travel, on the difficulty of
1640: reading Ariosto in these busy times, on the want of equilibrium in
1641: French political affairs, and on the pre-eminence of German music, he
1642: would know what to think. Felicia was evidently embarrassed by his
1643: reverent wonder, and, in dread lest she should seem to be playing the
1644: oracle, became somewhat confused, stumbling on her answers rather than
1645: choosing them. But this made no difference to Hinze's rapt attention and
1646: subdued eagerness of inquiry. He continued to put large questions,
1647: bending his head slightly that his eyes might be a little lifted in
1648: awaiting her reply.
1649: 
1650: "What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?"
1651: 
1652: "Oh," said Felicia, with a light deprecatory laugh, "I think it suffers
1653: from two diseases--bad taste in the patrons and want of inspiration in
1654: the artists."
1655: 
1656: "That is true indeed," said Hinze, in an undertone of deep conviction.
1657: "You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline.
1658: To a cultivated taste like yours this must be particularly painful."
1659: 
1660: "I did not say there was actual decline," said Felicia, with a touch of
1661: _brusquerie_. "I don't set myself up as the great personage whom nothing
1662: can please."
1663: 
1664: "That would be too severe a misfortune for others," says my
1665: complimentary ape. "You approve, perhaps, of Rosemary's 'Babes in the
1666: Wood,' as something fresh and _naïve_ in sculpture?"
1667: 
1668: "I think it enchanting."
1669: 
1670: "Does he know that? Or _will_ you permit me to tell him?"
1671: 
1672: "Heaven forbid! It would be an impertinence in me to praise a work of
1673: his--to pronounce on its quality; and that I happen to like it can be of
1674: no consequence to him."
1675: 
1676: Here was an occasion for Hinze to smile down on his hat and stroke
1677: it--Felicia's ignorance that her praise was inestimable being peculiarly
1678: noteworthy to an observer of mankind. Presently he was quite sure that
1679: her favourite author was Shakspere, and wished to know what she thought
1680: of Hamlet's madness. When she had quoted Wilhelm Meister on this point,
1681: and had afterwards testified that "Lear" was beyond adequate
1682: presentation, that "Julius Caesar" was an effective acting play, and
1683: that a poet may know a good deal about human nature while knowing little
1684: of geography, Hinze appeared so impressed with the plenitude of these
1685: revelations that he recapitulated them, weaving them together with
1686: threads of compliment--"As you very justly observed;" and--"It is most
1687: true, as you say;" and--"It were well if others noted what you have
1688: remarked."
1689: 
1690: Some listeners incautious in their epithets would have called Hinze an
1691: "ass." For my part I would never insult that intelligent and
1692: unpretending animal who no doubt brays with perfect simplicity and
1693: substantial meaning to those acquainted with his idiom, and if he feigns
1694: more submission than he feels, has weighty reasons for doing so--I would
1695: never, I say, insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal, the ass,
1696: by giving his name to a man whose continuous pretence is so shallow in
1697: its motive, so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of Hinze's.
1698: 
1699: But perhaps you would say that his adulatory manner was originally
1700: adopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly
1701: over-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the
1702: unreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf
1703: will shout to everybody else.
1704: 
1705: And you might indeed imagine that in talking to Tulpian, who has
1706: considerable interest at his disposal, Hinze had a desired appointment
1707: in his mind. Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, and if he
1708: is unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with
1709: instructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are
1710: registered and reported with more or less exactitude. But I think he
1711: has no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who,
1712: figuratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any
1713: dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop. Tulpian,
1714: with reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a
1715: mind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his
1716: higher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable
1717: characters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to
1718: the ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand
1719: associations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are. But
1720: Hinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his
1721: crotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them
1722: whether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these
1723: crotchets have been published. If an expert is explaining some matter on
1724: which you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian's
1725: guesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them.
1726: 
1727: In general, Hinze delights in the citation of opinions, and would
1728: hardly remark that the sun shone without an air of respectful appeal or
1729: fervid adhesion. The 'Iliad,' one sees, would impress him little if it
1730: were not for what Mr Fugleman has lately said about it; and if you
1731: mention an image or sentiment in Chaucer he seems not to heed the
1732: bearing of your reference, but immediately tells you that Mr Hautboy,
1733: too, regards Chaucer as a poet of the first order, and he is delighted
1734: to find that two such judges as you and Hautboy are at one.
1735: 
1736: What is the reason of all this subdued ecstasy, moving about, hat in
1737: hand, with well-dressed hair and attitudes of unimpeachable correctness?
1738: Some persons conscious of sagacity decide at once that Hinze knows what
1739: he is about in flattering Tulpian, and has a carefully appraised end to
1740: serve though they may not see it. They are misled by the common mistake
1741: of supposing that men's behaviour, whether habitual or occasional, is
1742: chiefly determined by a distinctly conceived motive, a definite object
1743: to be gained or a definite evil to be avoided. The truth is, that, the
1744: primitive wants of nature once tolerably satisfied, the majority of
1745: mankind, even in a civilised life full of solicitations, are with
1746: difficulty aroused to the distinct conception of an object towards which
1747: they will direct their actions with careful adaptation, and it is yet
1748: rarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such an
1749: end. Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation
1750: of definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of
1751: continuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such
1752: control by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the
1753: distinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly made
1754: up of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in
1755: unreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate
1756: promptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose. They
1757: pay their poor-rates, give their vote in affairs political or parochial,
1758: wear a certain amount of starch, hinder boys from tormenting the
1759: helpless, and spend money on tedious observances called pleasures,
1760: without mentally adjusting these practices to their own well-understood
1761: interest or to the general, ultimate welfare of the human race; and when
1762: they fall into ungraceful compliment, excessive smiling or other
1763: luckless efforts of complaisant behaviour, these are but the tricks or
1764: habits gradually formed under the successive promptings of a wish to be
1765: agreeable, stimulated day by day without any widening resources for
1766: gratifying the wish. It does not in the least follow that they are
1767: seeking by studied hypocrisy to get something for themselves. And so
1768: with Hinze's deferential bearing, complimentary parentheses, and
1769: worshipful tones, which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a
1770: comedy. He expects no appointment or other appreciable gain through
1771: Tulpian's favour; he has no doubleness towards Felicia; there is no
1772: sneering or backbiting obverse to his ecstatic admiration. He is very
1773: well off in the world, and cherishes no unsatisfied ambition that could
1774: feed design and direct flattery. As you perceive, he has had the
1775: education and other advantages of a gentleman without being conscious of
1776: marked result, such as a decided preference for any particular ideas or
1777: functions: his mind is furnished as hotels are, with everything for
1778: occasional and transient use. But one cannot be an Englishman and
1779: gentleman in general: it is in the nature of things that one must have
1780: an individuality, though it may be of an often-repeated type. As Hinze
1781: in growing to maturity had grown into a particular form and expression
1782: of person, so he necessarily gathered a manner and frame of speech which
1783: made him additionally recognisable. His nature is not tuned to the pitch
1784: of a genuine direct admiration, only to an attitudinising deference
1785: which does not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgments. All
1786: human achievement must be wrought down to this spoon-meat--this mixture
1787: of other persons' washy opinions and his own flux of reverence for what
1788: is third-hand, before Hinze can find a relish for it.
1789: 
1790: He has no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with
1791: those who are justly distinguished; he has no base admirations, and you
1792: may know by his entire presentation of himself, from the management of
1793: his hat to the angle at which he keeps his right foot, that he aspires
1794: to correctness. Desiring to behave becomingly and also to make a figure
1795: in dialogue, he is only like the bad artist whose picture is a failure.
1796: We may pity these ill-gifted strivers, but not pretend that their works
1797: are pleasant to behold. A man is bound to know something of his own
1798: weight and muscular dexterity, and the puny athlete is called foolish
1799: before he is seen to be thrown. Hinze has not the stuff in him to be at
1800: once agreeably conversational and sincere, and he has got himself up to
1801: be at all events agreeably conversational. Notwithstanding this
1802: deliberateness of intention in his talk he is unconscious of falsity,
1803: for he has not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast
1804: or diversity between his words and his thoughts. He is not fairly to be
1805: called a hypocrite, but I have already confessed to the more
1806: exasperation at his make-believe reverence, because it has no deep
1807: hunger to excuse it.
1808: 
1809: 
1810: 
1811: 
1812: VI.
1813: 
1814: 
1815: ONLY TEMPER.
1816: 
1817: What is temper? Its primary meaning, the proportion and mode in which
1818: qualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even
1819: here the word often carries a reference to an habitual state or general
1820: tendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be
1821: specific virtues and vices. As people confess to bad memory without
1822: expecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to
1823: have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high
1824: quality. When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is
1825: accused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal
1826: bearish mood he is kindness itself. If he kicks small animals, swears
1827: violently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his
1828: wife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they
1829: are all temper.
1830: 
1831: Certainly there is a limit to this form of apology, and the forgery of a
1832: bill, or the ordering of goods without any prospect of paying for them,
1833: has never been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of
1834: irascibility. But on the whole there is a peculiar exercise of
1835: indulgence towards the manifestations of bad temper which tends to
1836: encourage them, so that we are in danger of having among us a number of
1837: virtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably, just as we have
1838: hysterical patients who, with sound organs, are apparently labouring
1839: under many sorts of organic disease. Let it be admitted, however, that a
1840: man may be "a good fellow" and yet have a bad temper, so bad that we
1841: recognise his merits with reluctance, and are inclined to resent his
1842: occasionally amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our admiration.
1843: 
1844: Touchwood is that kind of good fellow. He is by turns insolent,
1845: quarrelsome, repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach him
1846: with respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate
1847: demands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to
1848: rude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in
1849: general--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a
1850: steadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted
1851: creature. Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his
1852: intimacy becomes insupportable! A man who uses his balmorals to tread on
1853: your toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a
1854: fast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived
1855: and your toes are tender. The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is
1856: not to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your
1857: understanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on
1858: an occasion which may never arise. I cannot submit to a chronic state of
1859: blue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident.
1860: 
1861: Touchwood's bad temper is of the contradicting pugnacious sort. He is
1862: the honourable gentleman in opposition, whatever proposal or proposition
1863: may be broached, and when others join him he secretly damns their
1864: superfluous agreement, quickly discovering that his way of stating the
1865: case is not exactly theirs. An invitation or any sign of expectation
1866: throws him into an attitude of refusal. Ask his concurrence in a
1867: benevolent measure: he will not decline to give it, because he has a
1868: real sympathy with good aims; but he complies resentfully, though where
1869: he is let alone he will do much more than any one would have thought of
1870: asking for. No man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the
1871: imputation of not paying his debts, yet when a bill is sent in with any
1872: promptitude he is inclined to make the tradesman wait for the money he
1873: is in such a hurry to get. One sees that this antagonistic temper must
1874: be much relieved by finding a particular object, and that its worst
1875: moments must be those where the mood is that of vague resistance, there
1876: being nothing specific to oppose. Touchwood is never so little engaging
1877: as when he comes down to breakfast with a cloud on his brow, after
1878: parting from you the night before with an affectionate effusiveness at
1879: the end of a confidential conversation which has assured you of mutual
1880: understanding. Impossible that you can have committed any offence. If
1881: mice have disturbed him, that is not your fault; but, nevertheless, your
1882: cheerful greeting had better not convey any reference to the weather,
1883: else it will be met by a sneer which, taking you unawares, may give you
1884: a crushing sense that you make a poor figure with your cheerfulness,
1885: which was not asked for. Some daring person perhaps introduces another
1886: topic, and uses the delicate flattery of appealing to Touchwood for his
1887: opinion, the topic being included in his favourite studies. An
1888: indistinct muttering, with a look at the carving-knife in reply, teaches
1889: that daring person how ill he has chosen a market for his deference. If
1890: Touchwood's behaviour affects you very closely you had better break your
1891: leg in the course of the day: his bad temper will then vanish at once;
1892: he will take a painful journey on your behalf; he will sit up with you
1893: night after night; he will do all the work of your department so as to
1894: save you from any loss in consequence of your accident; he will be even
1895: uniformly tender to you till you are well on your legs again, when he
1896: will some fine morning insult you without provocation, and make you wish
1897: that his generous goodness to you had not closed your lips against
1898: retort.
1899: 
1900: It is not always necessary that a friend should break his leg for
1901: Touchwood to feel compunction and endeavour to make amends for his
1902: bearishness or insolence. He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has
1903: misbehaved, and he is not only ashamed of himself, but has the better
1904: prompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted. Unhappily the
1905: habit of being offensive "without meaning it" leads usually to a way of
1906: making amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being
1907: amiable without meaning it. The kindnesses, the complimentary
1908: indications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance
1909: adjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer
1910: call up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for. They are not a
1911: spontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation. And,
1912: in fact, Dion's atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality.
1913: Because he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now
1914: expresses more than he quite feels. It is in vain. Having made you
1915: extremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his
1916: power of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by
1917: excessive effort, but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather
1918: than to be warmed by his episodic show of regard.
1919: 
1920: I suspect that many persons who have an uncertain, incalculable temper
1921: flatter themselves that it enhances their fascination; but perhaps they
1922: are under the prior mistake of exaggerating the charm which they suppose
1923: to be thus strengthened; in any case they will do well not to trust in
1924: the attractions of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for
1925: close intercourse. A pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorers
1926: by harassing them, but if she lets one of them make her his wife, the
1927: point of view from which he will look at her poutings and tossings and
1928: mysterious inability to be pleased will be seriously altered. And if
1929: slavery to a pretty woman, which seems among the least conditional forms
1930: of abject service, will not bear too great a strain from her bad temper
1931: even though her beauty remain the same, it is clear that a man whose
1932: claims lie in his high character or high performances had need impress
1933: us very constantly with his peculiar value and indispensableness, if he
1934: is to test our patience by an uncertainty of temper which leaves us
1935: absolutely without grounds for guessing how he will receive our persons
1936: or humbly advanced opinions, or what line he will take on any but the
1937: most momentous occasions.
1938: 
1939: For it is among the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is
1940: supposed to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to
1941: determine a man's sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal
1942: or impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds.
1943: The adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent
1944: for his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been
1945: inconsistent with his true mind. This determination of partisanship by
1946: temper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is
1947: always in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks
1948: into facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get
1949: evidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under
1950: an impulse dependent on something else than knowledge. There has been
1951: plenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master,
1952: and having the judgment uniformly controlled by a "He said it;" but a
1953: much worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by
1954: an "I said it"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or
1955: passion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour. There is
1956: hardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts.
1957: Hence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young
1958: enough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and
1959: use his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous
1960: manner. For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life,
1961: his capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency,
1962: and he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can
1963: contradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have
1964: shown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his
1965: sympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the
1966: example which your mind is following. He is at least free from those
1967: fetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary
1968: speaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the
1969: great book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put
1970: his best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society;
1971: because I should then have steady ground for bearing with his diurnal
1972: incalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to
1973: that unvarying monumental service. Unhappily, Touchwood's great powers
1974: have been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated.
1975: Everybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do
1976: would be done in a first-rate manner. Is it his love of disappointing
1977: complacent expectancy which has gone so far as to keep up this
1978: lamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive
1979: work which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him?
1980: 
1981: One can see that if Touchwood were to become a public man and take to
1982: frequent speaking on platforms or from his seat in the House, it would
1983: hardly be possible for him to maintain much integrity of opinion, or to
1984: avoid courses of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would
1985: stamp with discredit. Say that he were endowed with the purest honesty,
1986: it would inevitably be dragged captive by this mysterious, Protean bad
1987: temper. There would be the fatal public necessity of justifying
1988: oratorical Temper which had got on its legs in its bitter mood and made
1989: insulting imputations, or of keeping up some decent show of consistency
1990: with opinions vented out of Temper's contradictoriness. And words would
1991: have to be followed up by acts of adhesion.
1992: 
1993: Certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, he must be so
1994: under extreme difficulties. I doubt the possibility that a high order of
1995: character can coexist with a temper like Touchwood's. For it is of the
1996: nature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental
1997: habits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception,
1998: conviction, and impulse. There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a
1999: human nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in
2000: its windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high
2001: character, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities
2002: shall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not
2003: perfectly, obeyed.
2004: 
2005: If a man frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false attitudes,
2006: intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and
2007: falls into the consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make
2008: amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the
2009: less ugly because they are ascribed to "temper." Especially I object to
2010: the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is
2011: either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper
2012: yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a
2013: breakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he
2014: will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he
2015: lives. Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main
2016: object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in
2017: his lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of
2018: is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful
2019: of my own offences, to bear him no malice. But I cannot accept his
2020: amends.
2021: 
2022: If the bad-tempered man wants to apologise he had need to do it on a
2023: large public scale, make some beneficent discovery, produce some
2024: stimulating work of genius, invent some powerful process--prove himself
2025: such a good to contemporary multitudes and future generations, as to
2026: make the discomfort he causes his friends and acquaintances a vanishing
2027: quality, a trifle even in their own estimate.

2033: 
2034: 
2035: A POLITICAL MOLECULE.
2036: 
2037: The most arrant denier must admit that a man often furthers larger ends
2038: than he is conscious of, and that while he is transacting his particular
2039: affairs with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant, he subserves
2040: an economy larger than any purpose of his own. Society is happily not
2041: dependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already
2042: endowed with comprehensive sympathy: any molecule of the body politic
2043: working towards his own interest in an orderly way gets his
2044: understanding more or less penetrated with the fact that his interest is
2045: included in that of a large number. I have watched several political
2046: molecules being educated in this way by the nature of things into a
2047: faint feeling of fraternity. But at this moment I am thinking of Spike,
2048: an elector who voted on the side of Progress though he was not inwardly
2049: attached to it under that name. For abstractions are deities having many
2050: specific names, local habitations, and forms of activity, and so get a
2051: multitude of devout servants who care no more for them under their
2052: highest titles than the celebrated person who, putting with forcible
2053: brevity a view of human motives now much insisted on, asked what
2054: Posterity had done for him that he should care for Posterity? To many
2055: minds even among the ancients (thought by some to have been invariably
2056: poetical) the goddess of wisdom was doubtless worshipped simply as the
2057: patroness of spinning and weaving. Now spinning and weaving from a
2058: manufacturing, wholesale point of view, was the chief form under which
2059: Spike from early years had unconsciously been a devotee of Progress.
2060: 
2061: He was a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance, not
2062: less than six feet high, and showing the utmost nicety in the care of
2063: his person and equipment. His umbrella was especially remarkable for its
2064: neatness, though perhaps he swung it unduly in walking. His complexion
2065: was fresh, his eyes small, bright, and twinkling. He was seen to great
2066: advantage in a hat and greatcoat--garments frequently fatal to the
2067: impressiveness of shorter figures; but when he was uncovered in the
2068: drawing-room, it was impossible not to observe that his head shelved off
2069: too rapidly from the eyebrows towards the crown, and that his length of
2070: limb seemed to have used up his mind so as to cause an air of
2071: abstraction from conversational topics. He appeared, indeed, to be
2072: preoccupied with a sense of his exquisite cleanliness, clapped his hands
2073: together and rubbed them frequently, straightened his back, and even
2074: opened his mouth and closed it again with a slight snap, apparently for
2075: no other purpose than the confirmation to himself of his own powers in
2076: that line. These are innocent exercises, but they are not such as give
2077: weight to a man's personality. Sometimes Spike's mind, emerging from its
2078: preoccupation, burst forth in a remark delivered with smiling zest; as,
2079: that he did like to see gravel walks well rolled, or that a lady should
2080: always wear the best jewellery, or that a bride was a most interesting
2081: object; but finding these ideas received rather coldly, he would relapse
2082: into abstraction, draw up his back, wrinkle his brows longitudinally,
2083: and seem to regard society, even including gravel walks, jewellery, and
2084: brides, as essentially a poor affair. Indeed his habit of mind was
2085: desponding, and he took melancholy views as to the possible extent of
2086: human pleasure and the value of existence. Especially after he had made
2087: his fortune in the cotton manufacture, and had thus attained the chief
2088: object of his ambition--the object which had engaged his talent for
2089: order and persevering application. For his easy leisure caused him much
2090: _ennui_. He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual
2091: excess which fill up a man's time first with indulgence and then with
2092: the process of getting well from its effects. He had not, indeed,
2093: exhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human
2094: pleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed
2095: rather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a
2096: Catholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of
2097: moral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further
2098: inquiries on these remote matters. Yet he aspired to what he regarded as
2099: intellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and
2100: bought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the
2101: shelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in
2102: the same room with them. But some minds seem well glazed by nature
2103: against the admission of knowledge, and Spike's was one of them. It was
2104: not, however, entirely so with regard to politics. He had had a strong
2105: opinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading
2106: towns ought to send members. Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed
2107: and glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal. In this
2108: last particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making
2109: loans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness. On the Repeal
2110: of the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced. His mind was
2111: expansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that
2112: the people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods
2113: which they had hitherto dispensed with. On his conduct in these
2114: political concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who
2115: belonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in
2116: marrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was
2117: called her husband's "radicalism"--an epithet which was a very unfair
2118: impeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything. But he
2119: understood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,
2120: constant political element. If he had been born a little later he could
2121: have been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had
2122: belonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the
2123: Government. Perhaps his indifference to "views" would have passed for
2124: administrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent
2125: that he must often have been silent in the right place. But this is
2126: empty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have
2127: been and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he
2128: had not been educated by having to manage his trade. A small mind
2129: trained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes
2130: a representative of genuine class-needs. Spike objected to certain items
2131: of legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours'
2132: trade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been
2133: simply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a
2134: fellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by
2135: all his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him
2136: to a sense of common injury and common benefit. True, if the law could
2137: have been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving
2138: the cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,
2139: Spike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the
2140: nature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as
2141: possible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the
2142: enlargement of his neighbours' market, and the Possible is always the
2143: ultimate master of our efforts and desires. Spike was obliged to
2144: contemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite
2145: of himself. Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism
2146: into a demand for a public benefit. Certainly if Spike had been born a
2147: marquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a
2148: political element. But he might have had the same appearance, have been
2149: equally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,
2150: and destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking
2151: Jesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the
2152: inventor of physical science. The depths of middle-aged gentlemen's
2153: ignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this
2154: branch.

2160: 
2161: 
2162: THE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE
2163: 
2164: Mordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,
2165: public-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in
2166: conveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling. Pity that to all these
2167: graces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the
2168: occasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank
2169: welcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind! But
2170: no: Mordax's self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which
2171: demands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage
2172: over him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having
2173: his notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel
2174: for so kindly and conscientious a man.
2175: 
2176: "You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax," said
2177: Acer, the other day, "but I have not much belief in virtues that are
2178: always requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them.
2179: True fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are
2180: conspicuously absent. I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of
2181: the world are not likely to stand up for. It does not need much love of
2182: truth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac
2183: Newton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my
2184: notes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one
2185: already crowned. It is my way to apply tests. Does the man who has the
2186: ear of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who
2187: may be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn?
2188: That is my test of his justice and benevolence."
2189: 
2190: My answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as
2191: what ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning. If the
2192: scholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the
2193: shortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken. But the
2194: better-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of
2195: legs able to walk east or west according to choice. Intellect is no
2196: longer taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or
2197: mediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in
2198: one line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other
2199: directions, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which
2200: is a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another. We have
2201: convinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial
2202: physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in
2203: theorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in
2204: physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may
2205: seem the "poor Poll" of the company in conversation and yet write with
2206: some humorous vigour. It is not true that a man's intellectual power is
2207: like the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point.
2208: 
2209: Why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called
2210: consistency to a man's moral nature, and argue against the existence of
2211: fine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions
2212: generally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases
2213: which act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism? The mistake
2214: might be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or
2215: acts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good
2216: dispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves. All
2217: other persons are able to draw a milder conclusion. Laniger, who has a
2218: temper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way
2219: by Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at
2220: heart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think
2221: no worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who
2222: has lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful
2223: enough of Laniger's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature
2224: with admiring gratitude. There is a fable that when the badger had been
2225: stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of
2226: how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied,
2227: peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your
2228: muzzle." The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of
2229: altruism.
2230: 
2231: But this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only
2232: mirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and
2233: that of the man who has injured him. If those neutral, perhaps even
2234: affectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,
2235: how should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in
2236: what he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified
2237: man to the unqualified? Depend upon it, his conscience, though active
2238: enough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his
2239: polemical rudeness and even brutality. He would go from the room where
2240: he has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting
2241: and turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in
2242: which he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could
2243: tell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the
2244: eminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so. Does
2245: this nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his
2246: suffering friend? Not at all. It only proves that his arrogant egoism,
2247: set on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been
2248: the dews of fellowship and pity. He is angry and equips himself
2249: accordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_
2250: countenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots
2251: to give him his dismissal. All this to teach him who the Romans really
2252: were, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an
2253: important service to mankind.
2254: 
2255: When a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can
2256: always regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the
2257: more easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy
2258: of indignation. I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object
2259: all the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if
2260: the administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth
2261: and posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence. In
2262: transactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the
2263: first place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately
2264: concerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century
2265: but one. Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of
2266: the highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that
2267: touches the mixed life of the earth. They are archangels with awful brow
2268: and flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the
2269: divinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but
2270: to learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the
2271: mortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own
2272: appetites. I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of
2273: Central Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that
2274: the future populations there will be none the worse off because I
2275: abstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present
2276: parliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious
2277: to my contemporaries. On the whole, and in the vast majority of
2278: instances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of
2279: the sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries. A
2280: sour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does
2281: harm. The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and
2282: the wish to hasten his Master's declaration of himself as the Messiah.
2283: Perhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive
2284: in this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief
2285: that he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at
2286: the bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was
2287: not convinced that his action was detestable. I refuse to accept a man
2288: who has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the
2289: redemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses
2290: shall be those of peace and righteousness.
2291: 
2292: All this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not
2293: founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the
2294: compatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature
2295: which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also
2296: to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our
2297: acts immediately (not distantly) concern. Will any one be so hardy as to
2298: maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant? I
2299: think most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary. And it is
2300: of the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and
2301: self-justifying. There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,
2302: and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason. This
2303: is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain
2304: the outleap of roar and talons.
2305: 
2306: As to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not
2307: discovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and
2308: shrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a
2309: mental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor
2310: Conceited Ignorance.
2311: 
2312: I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,
2313: whose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he
2314: writes _night_ as _nit_. One day, looking over his accounts, I said to
2315: him jocosely, "You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:
2316: most people spell "night" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but
2317: the greatest scholars now spell it as you do." "So I suppose, sir,"
2318: says Pummel; "I've see it with a _gh_, but I've noways give into that
2319: myself." You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise. I
2320: have sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them
2321: all, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear
2322: to notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that
2323: strong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply
2324: impossible for him to feel himself newly informed. If I tell him that
2325: the world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is
2326: spinning with it, he says, "Yes, I've heard a deal of that in my time,
2327: sir," and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,
2328: balancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full.
2329: Whether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks
2330: with fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is
2331: the pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a
2332: respectable stranger, Pummel replies, "So I suppose, sir," with an air
2333: of resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as
2334: elders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an
2335: anecdote book. His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he
2336: would have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your
2337: needless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, "I
2338: should say."
2339: 
2340: "Pummel," I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, "if
2341: you were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a
2342: morning, your water would boil there sooner." "I should say, sir." "Or,
2343: there are boiling springs in Iceland. Better go to Iceland." "That's
2344: what I've been thinking, sir."
2345: 
2346: I have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never
2347: admits his own inability to answer them without representing it as
2348: common to the human race. "What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?"
2349: 
2350: "Well, sir, nobody rightly knows. Many gives their opinion, but if I
2351: was to give mine, it 'ud be different."
2352: 
2353: But while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining
2354: situations of surprise for others. His own consciousness is that of one
2355: so thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is
2356: impossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of
2357: thirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle. His great
2358: interest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at
2359: what they see in England, and especially at the beef. He is often
2360: occupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the
2361: assembled animals--"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b'y to
2362: Wombwell's shows." He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as
2363: shoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to
2364: that small upstart, with some severity, "Now don't you pretend to know,
2365: because the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance"--a lucidity
2366: on his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly
2367: self-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of
2368: humility in others.
2369: 
2370: Your diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others
2371: should feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not
2372: otherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit
2373: next a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous
2374: fellow-traveller. It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts
2375: that his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as
2376: one is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff
2377: for which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself.
2378: 
2379: But your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to
2380: be ill-founded. The service he regards society as most in need of is to
2381: put down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is
2382: inclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age. In
2383: the schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or
2384: even under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that
2385: presumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall. The
2386: way people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing
2387: to mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting. It
2388: might seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value
2389: should prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were
2390: not for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which
2391: anybody has appeared to undervalue him.

2397: 
2398: 
2399: A HALF-BREED
2400: 
2401: An early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing
2402: Nemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys
2403: by the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change. I
2404: refer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,
2405: practical beliefs, and social habits. And faithlessness here means not a
2406: gradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to
2407: seductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a
2408: mistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire. In
2409: this sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an
2410: abandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido. The child
2411: of a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he
2412: feels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his
2413: nature into tune. But there is no such recovery possible to the man who
2414: remembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in
2415: error, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved
2416: habits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious
2417: justification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new.
2418: This involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out
2419: of tune. He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of
2420: obtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the
2421: most unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and
2422: the oböe confounding both.
2423: 
2424: Hence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he
2425: spends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment. To
2426: most observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also
2427: sharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become
2428: what they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but
2429: surprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and
2430: distinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness
2431: which prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way
2432: through his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with
2433: all this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly
2434: conscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social
2435: distinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without
2436: envying. Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that
2437: he aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine
2438: that his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the
2439: most unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his
2440: chosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a
2441: religious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady
2442: on whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious
2443: literature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys
2444: of a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given
2445: specially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational
2446: preacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then
2447: far beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect. At that time Mixtus
2448: thought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious
2449: principles and religious yearnings. It was within his prospects also to
2450: be rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for
2451: reforming and religious purposes. His opinions were of a strongly
2452: democratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of
2453: employers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would
2454: restrict the expansiveness of trade. He was the most democratic in
2455: relation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed
2456: interest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the
2457: poor. Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in
2458: ideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious
2459: communion, and good works. If you had known him then you would have
2460: expected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,
2461: sharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage
2462: his studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished
2463: part in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great
2464: provincial capital.
2465: 
2466: How is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society
2467: totally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years? And whom
2468: _did_ he marry?
2469: 
2470: Why, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated
2471: others, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music. It is a common
2472: enough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly
2473: the opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least
2474: effectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an
2475: unwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been
2476: transient. Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side
2477: of his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side
2478: by side with his philanthropic and religious tastes. He had ability in
2479: business, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,
2480: and the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure
2481: of rewarded exertion. It was during a business sojourn in London that he
2482: met Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of
2483: Greek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists
2484: patronised by such wealthy entertainers. Mixtus on this occasion became
2485: familiar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant
2486: sort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial
2487: circles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway? A
2488: man bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,
2489: make morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing
2490: it in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of
2491: tables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a
2492: finish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that
2493: unhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason.
2494: Enough.
2495: 
2496: Mixtus married Scintilla. Now this lively lady knew nothing of
2497: Nonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not
2498: distinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his
2499: enlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite
2500: so ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the
2501: Baptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the
2502: Methodists. In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any
2503: sort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed
2504: rather absurd to Scintilla. Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced
2505: oddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable
2506: things were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to
2507: subscribe to something. They were probably ignorant of art and music,
2508: did not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing
2509: amusing. In Scintilla's eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and
2510: deplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with
2511: which she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people
2512: understood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most
2513: ridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable.
2514: 
2515: Did Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla's before their marriage?
2516: Or did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which
2517: had made half the occupation of his youth?
2518: 
2519: When a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any
2520: committal of himself, this woman's opinions, however different from his
2521: own, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they
2522: are merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the
2523: Trinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply
2524: regards her lover's troubling himself in disputation on these heads as
2525: stuff and nonsense. The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure
2526: that marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which
2527: he is in earnest. And to laugh at men's affairs is a woman's privilege,
2528: tending to enliven the domestic hearth. If Scintilla had no liking for
2529: the best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias
2530: towards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite
2531: contented not to go to church.
2532: 
2533: As to Scintilla's acquaintance with her lover's tastes on these
2534: subjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband's queer
2535: ways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he
2536: had married an adroit woman. Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent
2537: creature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to
2538: have all the advantages of a rich man's wife. She was not in the least a
2539: wicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an
2540: aptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most
2541: of.
2542: 
2543: But we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus. He has become
2544: richer even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and
2545: entertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and
2546: artistic society which he is proud to think select. This society regards
2547: him as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has
2548: become a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the
2549: list of one's acquaintance. But from every other point of view Mixtus
2550: finds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt
2551: by his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to
2552: think with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses. He is
2553: transplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other
2554: than the old lines of vigorous growth. How could he speak to the artist
2555: Crespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr
2556: Apollos? How could he mention to them his former efforts towards
2557: evangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys? And his references to his
2558: historical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets
2559: for English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by
2560: many of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice
2561: concerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the
2562: currier's wide views on the applicability of leather. He can only make a
2563: figure through his genial hospitality. It is in vain that he buys the
2564: best pictures and statues of the best artists. Nobody will call him a
2565: judge in art. If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is
2566: generally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla
2567: in other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and
2568: often questionable taste. Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not
2569: ignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,
2570: but not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man. He has
2571: consequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and
2572: in his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when
2573: speaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the
2574: earlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various
2575: aspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what
2576: others take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or
2577: less accept). He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of
2578: his old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace
2579: of freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;
2580: but he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means
2581: by which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will
2582: arrive at the exclamation "Give me money!" with the tone and gesture of
2583: a man who both feels and knows. Then if one of his audience, not having
2584: money, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money
2585: because he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,
2586: cordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which
2587: indeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the
2588: admirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not
2589: himself reckoned among them. Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was
2590: a time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the
2591: press of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the
2592: manuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always
2593: increasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite
2594: topics. And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and
2595: can remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of
2596: colonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at
2597: present consume a sufficiently large share of our products and
2598: manufactures. He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of
2599: Christianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,
2600: brown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the
2601: sort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband's
2602: table, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come
2603: before the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the
2604: commercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should
2605: prove needful as a pioneer of Christianity. He has long been wont to
2606: feel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment
2607: having consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,
2608: his avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their
2609: public acknowledgment.
2610: 
2611: There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social
2612: questions and duties. He has not lost the kindness that used to make him
2613: a benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in
2614: helping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active
2615: superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
2616: more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
2617: a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries. Hence many who have
2618: occasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude
2619: him to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and
2620: money-getting men. Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what
2621: Mixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know
2622: it.
2623: 
2624: 
2625: 
2626: 
2627: X.
2628: 
2629: 
2630: DEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY.
2631: 
2632: "Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule où il n'y en a point: c'est se gâter
2633: le goût, c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres. Mais le
2634: ridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grâce
2635: et d'une manière qui plaise et qui instruise."
2636: 
2637: I am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyère, because the subject
2638: is one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my
2639: sentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient
2640: sense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that
2641: enhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of
2642: unfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common
2643: things, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the
2644: influence. I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in
2645: English the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent
2646: death of his father in the July days. The narrative had impressed her,
2647: through the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something
2648: quite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her
2649: audience cold, she broke off, saying, "It sounded so much finer in
2650: French--_j'ai vu le sang de mon père_, and so on--I wish I could repeat
2651: it in French." This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady
2652: who had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I
2653: observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring
2654: acceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly
2655: desire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the
2656: fashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyère's idiom. But I wish he had
2657: added that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the
2658: chief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of
2659: endowment, but of deficiency. The art of spoiling is within reach of the
2660: dullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might
2661: chip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand
2662: grinning at the effect of his work. Because wit is an exquisite product
2663: of high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused
2664: inference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his
2665: superiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on
2666: which he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has
2667: distorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him
2668: as a joking apparatus. Some high authority is needed to give many worthy
2669: and timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing
2670: demand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of
2671: being taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to
2672: say that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their
2673: children of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,
2674: by burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in
2675: the stalls and their assistants in the gallery. The English people in
2676: the present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by
2677: some innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have
2678: known the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle
2679: discourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear
2680: prospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through
2681: burlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes. A
2682: bottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he
2683: will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind
2684: and Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and
2685: shepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of
2686: grenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous
2687: "attitude of the scissors" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches
2688: in "Hamlet" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be
2689: reduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver's puns--premonitory
2690: signs of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down
2691: with the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul
2692: naturally abhors.
2693: 
2694: I have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the
2695: ideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the
2696: burlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,
2697: seeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not
2698: appropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to
2699: make up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love. One would have
2700: thought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy
2701: outward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the
2702: consciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have
2703: made them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque
2704: which is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving
2705: view, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous
2706: caricature. It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that
2707: they parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they
2708: would at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by
2709: persecution. Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other
2710: excuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded
2711: appetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe's herd where
2712: they may defile every monument of that growing life which should have
2713: kept them human?
2714: 
2715: The world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:
2716: wit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing
2717: facets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling
2718: sea or the dewy meadows. Why should we make our delicious sense of the
2719: ludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its
2720: irrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as
2721: gentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on
2722: the robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a
2723: madman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the
2724: populace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened
2725: ruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at
2726: which we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and
2727: disfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the
2728: healthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be
2729: degraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds
2730: matter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion
2731: preposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a
2732: second chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever
2733: thrilled with light?
2734: 
2735: This is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of
2736: every inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less
2737: of the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm
2738: and elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by
2739: which man saves his soul alive. The bread-winner of the family may
2740: demand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for
2741: his day's work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that
2742: moral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase
2743: all historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the
2744: desecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling
2745: emotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one
2746: with social virtue.
2747: 
2748: And yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children
2749: ridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous "illustrations") of
2750: the poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry
2751: them to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or
2752: solemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,
2753: with its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their
2754: primary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious
2755: preparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what
2756: might have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of
2757: compassion, trust, and constancy. One wonders where these parents have
2758: deposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be
2759: independent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest
2760: images being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as
2761: with some befooling drug.
2762: 
2763: Will fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this
2764: turning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous
2765: laughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours? On the contrary.
2766: That delightful power which La Bruyère points to--"le ridicule qui est
2767: quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grâce et d'une manière
2768: qui plaise et qui instruise"--depends on a discrimination only
2769: compatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,
2770: and with the justice of perception which is another name for grave
2771: knowledge. Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the
2772: strain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest
2773: incongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of
2774: a sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he
2775: will notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his
2776: observation with the salt of historical parallels. But after all our
2777: psychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we
2778: are still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and
2779: habits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any
2780: particular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we
2781: are continually applying to them. We soak our children in habits of
2782: contempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa
2783: one day said to me--"We can always teach them to be reverent in the
2784: right place, you know." And doubtless if she were to take her boys to
2785: see a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of
2786: cockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among
2787: their bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the
2788: prejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative
2789: of the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of
2790: ages. This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new
2791: Famine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a
2792: moral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments. These are the
2793: most delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation. And
2794: here again I like to quote a French testimony. Sainte Beuve, referring
2795: to a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: "Rien de plus prompt à
2796: baisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en
2797: trois semaines le résultat de plusieurs siècles. La civilisation, la
2798: _vie_ est une chose apprise et inventée, qu'on le sache bien: '_Inventas
2799: aut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.' Les hommes après quelques années de
2800: paix oublient trop cette verité: ils arrivent à croire que la _culture_
2801: est chose innée, qu'elle est la même chose que la _nature_. La
2802: sauvagerie est toujours là à deux pas, et, dès qu'on lâche pied, elle
2803: recommence." We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to
2804: learn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,
2805: is helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or
2806: ideal feelings. And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a
2807: community, strive to maintain in efficient force. How if a dangerous
2808: "Swing" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to
2809: the amusement of mixed audiences? And I confess that sometimes when I
2810: see a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with
2811: rouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with
2812: slang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of
2813: things, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I
2814: am sorely tempted to hiss out "_Pétroleuse!_" It is a small matter to
2815: have our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense
2816: of a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the
2817: promise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by
2818: images of repulsiveness. These things come--not of higher education,
2819: but--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity
2820: which reverses Peter's visionary lesson and learns to call all things
2821: common and unclean. It comes of debasing the moral currency.
2822: 
2823: The Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,
2824: becoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and
2825: nothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,
2826: appealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure. The god
2827: prescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if
2828: they could carry it through without laughing. They did their best; but
2829: the flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this
2830: way the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a
2831: quick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people
2832: who in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor
2833: jest.

2841: THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB
2842: 
2843: No man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to
2844: communistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard
2845: to property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is
2846: disposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original
2847: authorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low. I have known him, indeed,
2848: insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a
2849: medieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or
2850: statement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this
2851: championship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead. He
2852: is evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than
2853: is due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain
2854: proprietorship even in spiritual production. But perhaps it is no real
2855: inconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,
2856: it is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the
2857: universe: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual
2858: products, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the
2859: infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the
2860: massive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on
2861: that growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or
2862: modes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically
2863: speaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused
2864: for not knowing how he got them. Above all, he insists on the proper
2865: subordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or
2866: combination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,
2867: must belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or
2868: populariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or
2869: Hottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their
2870: right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.
2871: 
2872: One may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be
2873: even religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode
2874: in which Euphorion seems to apply them. I protest against the use of
2875: these majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and
2876: justify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or
2877: enforced by the law. Especially since it is observable that the large
2878: views as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an
2879: able person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his
2880: own, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never
2881: hinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and
2882: applause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in
2883: the public ways, those conquerors whose battles and "annexations" even
2884: the carpenters and bricklayers know by name. Surely the acknowledgment
2885: of a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never
2886: be asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to
2887: "debts of honour" would be suitably transferred. There is no massive
2888: public opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of
2889: thinkers and investigators--relations to be thoroughly understood
2890: and felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and
2891: acquainted with their history. To lay false claim to an invention or
2892: discovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a
2893: professedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one
2894: already produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy
2895: somebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it
2896: about among friends as an original "effusion;" to deliver an elegant
2897: extract from a known writer as a piece of improvised
2898: eloquence:--these are the limits within which the dishonest
2899: pretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring
2900: more or less shame on the culprit. It is not necessary to understand
2901: the merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable
2902: confidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not
2903: respectable. But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these
2904: devices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling
2905: off them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people's
2906: philosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their
2907: moral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion. The pitiable
2908: jays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert
2909: incredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience
2910: who expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the
2911: world that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be
2912: due solely to his ingenuity. His borrowings are no incongruous
2913: feathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes
2914: them seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a
2915: melody. Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite
2916: society, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker
2917: has occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has
2918: lately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:
2919: one cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item
2920: of fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large
2921: class of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis
2922: of knowledge. But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed
2923: that he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes
2924: carries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of
2925: names in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can
2926: therefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases
2927: of larger "conveyance" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very
2928: association of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws
2929: of the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are
2930: resolved into Everybody's or Nobody's, and one man's particular
2931: obligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the
2932: earth to the solar system in general.
2933: 
2934: Euphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were
2935: brought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of
2936: explanation. It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as
2937: necessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well
2938: known--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for
2939: mention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might
2940: injure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark
2941: casts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has
2942: furnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate.
2943: No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the
2944: non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as
2945: well as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics
2946: whose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of
2947: the cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound
2948: learning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and
2949: disguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us. Knowl._
2950: took the place of the low word _Penny_. Works of this convenient stamp,
2951: easily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich
2952: but unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and
2953: whose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance
2954: on their names and places of abode. As to memory, it is known that this
2955: frail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to
2956: our self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to
2957: be approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them. But it is
2958: always interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or
2959: Scaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt. To know exactly what has
2960: been drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which
2961: seems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may
2962: pass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object
2963: except the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his
2964: figure when it is important to be seen oneself. All these reasons must
2965: weigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask
2966: themselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the
2967: particular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of
2968: service to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to
2969: him.
2970: 
2971: After all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is
2972: more difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a
2973: plagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate
2974: reproduction of them as original. The arguments on the side of acquittal
2975: are obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary
2976: thinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in
2977: our minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that
2978: if we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept
2979: them at once as a new inspiration. Then, in relation to the elder
2980: authors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of
2981: remembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of
2982: the world's history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago
2983: reappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry
2984: which is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were
2985: ancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and
2986: proving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner. On the other hand,
2987: the evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,
2988: though much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,
2989: is apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially
2990: of the resentful, condemnatory sort. How Pythagoras came by his ideas,
2991: whether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus
2992: must have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on
2993: which a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and
2994: charity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning
2995: fundamentally similar, of my neighbour's blameworthy behaviour in a case
2996: where I am personally concerned. No premisses require closer scrutiny
2997: than those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, "He must have
2998: known," or "He must have read." I marvel that this facility of belief on
2999: the side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the
3000: easiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to
3001: read. To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,
3002: grin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are
3003: artificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe
3004: supposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits.
3005: An author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining
3006: his condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are
3007: all apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be
3008: general, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,
3009: and our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent
3010: persons will listen long without weariness. But if the ardent author
3011: happen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide
3012: the larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read
3013: him and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite
3014: society, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish
3015: to conceal this negation and speak of his "incomparable works" with that
3016: trust in testimony which always has its cheering side.
3017: 
3018: Hence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of
3019: plagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a
3020: construction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday
3021: occurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really
3022: worthless, considered as proof. The length to which one man's memory can
3023: go in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly
3024: find a limit. It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an
3025: agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,
3026: with some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first
3027: to elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such
3028: instances of obliviousness. You naturally remember your peculiar
3029: connection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should
3030: _he_? Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an
3031: additional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of
3032: obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us
3033: in our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt
3034: to be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of
3035: polite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of
3036: celebration. In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the
3037: first weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best
3038: is precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of
3039: our neighbours. But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who
3040: borrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again
3041: forgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so
3042: much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind. Some absent persons
3043: cannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and
3044: have no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a
3045: fellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent
3046: householders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one
3047: wishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a
3048: neighbour's umbrella may be newer than their own.
3049: 
3050: True, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an
3051: idea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,
3052: yet especially theirs. It fits in so beautifully with their general
3053: wisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that
3054: if they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is
3055: clearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their
3056: immediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and
3057: appropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have
3058: alighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to
3059: that low kind of entity, a second cause. This is not lunacy, nor
3060: pretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and
3061: often carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to
3062: be a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo.
3063: Lighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met
3064: with among brilliant talkers. Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for
3065: any one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his
3066: conversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of
3067: booty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as
3068: if it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a
3069: tribute in kind. Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in
3070: gathering a showy stock of information than Aquila. On close inquiry you
3071: would probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern
3072: times, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and
3073: other official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his
3074: leisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few
3075: predatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,
3076: gradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on
3077: the dominant topic. When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls
3078: into mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into
3079: fuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing
3080: to admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of
3081: correction. Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some
3082: ingenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a
3083: hundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed
3084: to spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be
3085: taken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the
3086: most graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the
3087: continuation--"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two
3088: were all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world
3089: knows that nine thirteens will yield," &c.--proceeding straightway into
3090: a new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded
3091: by all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for
3092: ignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake. How should a
3093: small-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than
3094: the keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily
3095: credible? Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man's profile,
3096: voice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the
3097: twelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common
3098: things are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men
3099: found half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust
3100: may sometimes be held on no better foundation.
3101: 
3102: It is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in
3103: general, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the
3104: performances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to
3105: be, considering who is the performer. We all notice in our neighbours
3106: this reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish
3107: illustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we
3108: will, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a
3109: previous attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the
3110: influences of a name. But that our prior confidence or want of
3111: confidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the
3112: consequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly
3113: perceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the
3114: surprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an
3115: authorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses. No doubt
3116: if it had been discovered who wrote the 'Vestiges,' many an ingenious
3117: structure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust
3118: might have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby
3119: an appearance of likelihood. It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,
3120: founded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for
3121: those who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people's
3122: ideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,
3123: while any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an unwelcome
3124: disturbance of complacency with each person who has paid complimentary
3125: tributes in the wrong place.
3126: 
3127: Hardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the
3128: probabilities of origination. It would be amusing to catechise the
3129: guessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess "likely:"
3130: why Hoopoe of John's has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike
3131: attributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been
3132: known as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the
3133: reverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous
3134: judgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom
3135: they had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a
3136: species excluded by the nature of the case. Clearly they were all wrong
3137: in their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in
3138: the small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody
3139: knows where, in spite of somebody's knowing his uncles and cousins, and
3140: in spite of nobody's knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him.
3141: 
3142: Such guesses remind one of a fabulist's imaginary council of animals
3143: assembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb
3144: found and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures. The speakers all
3145: started from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was
3146: the quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the
3147: animals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have
3148: rejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a
3149: fish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society
3150: and their ways were little known. Several complimentary presumptions
3151: were expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired
3152: and popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the
3153: Nightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their
3154: confusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl
3155: hissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the
3156: animal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of
3157: whose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical
3158: procedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step. Some
3159: disturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself
3160: obtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling
3161: that he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an
3162: experimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to
3163: decision. The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring
3164: who his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able
3165: discourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so
3166: as to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition
3167: that there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been
3168: produced by one who understood it so well. But Bruin, who had probably
3169: eaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of
3170: language, that "Fine words butter no parsnips," by which he meant to say
3171: that there was no new honey forthcoming.
3172: 
3173: Perhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox
3174: entered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the
3175: beneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much
3176: smeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence
3177: indeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem
3178: a sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction
3179: Reynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so
3180: delicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that
3181: he had really found the honey-creating genius.
3182: 
3183: The Fox's admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were
3184: taken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a
3185: general desire for information on a point of interest. Nevertheless,
3186: there was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some
3187: eminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang's jaw dropped
3188: so as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying
3189: Pelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw
3190: became loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;
3191: while the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated
3192: the question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,
3193: instead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was
3194: now plain, had been much overestimated. But this narrow-spirited motion
3195: was negatived by the sweet-toothed majority. A complimentary deputation
3196: to the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this
3197: diplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey.

3204: 
3205: "SO YOUNG!"
3206: 
3207: Ganymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth. That one cannot
3208: for any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly
3209: handsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as
3210: worthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, "Socrates was
3211: mortal." But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede
3212: the illusion that he is surprisingly young. He was the last born of his
3213: family, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as
3214: such to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother
3215: speak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,
3216: which naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the
3217: habitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting.
3218: Then, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of
3219: astonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,
3220: and the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when
3221: he produced 'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations' before he was
3222: well out of his teens. All comers, on a first interview, told him that
3223: he was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time
3224: they saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the
3225: same ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be
3226: accounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the
3227: golden background which set off his many-hued endowments. Here was
3228: already enough to establish a strong association between his sense of
3229: identity and his sense of being unusually young. But after this he
3230: devised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the
3231: literary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including
3232: Australasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,
3233: which thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of
3234: an astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming
3235: administrator found to be remarkably young. If we imagine with due
3236: charity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit
3237: that he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than
3238: young, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that
3239: melancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon. Happily he had
3240: enough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate. He
3241: had not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his 'Comparative
3242: Estimate,' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,
3243: the sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen
3244: too early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a
3245: fatigued afternoon. He has continued to be productive both of schemes
3246: and writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his 'Comparative
3247: Estimate' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and
3248: left him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but
3249: might yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever.
3250: 
3251: I saw something of him through his Antinoüs period, the time of rich
3252: chesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed
3253: furrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left. In
3254: these slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle
3255: size, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable
3256: air of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial
3257: movements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in
3258: shirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his
3259: knowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he
3260: was making any great mistake about himself. He was only undergoing one
3261: form of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in
3262: the remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as
3263: a dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in
3264: correspondence. Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had
3265: lost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two
3266: who have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a
3267: pleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed
3268: haunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about
3269: himself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his
3270: neighbourhood. He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his
3271: surprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife
3272: considerably older than himself. It would probably have seemed to him a
3273: disturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him
3274: should have been younger than he, except his own children who, however
3275: young, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the
3276: youthfulness of their father. And if my glance had revealed my
3277: impression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather
3278: disagreeable shock, which was far from my intention. My mind, having
3279: retained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of
3280: unmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by
3281: way of flattering his subject. He had lost his slimness, and that curved
3282: solidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic
3283: threat to his short figure. The English branch of the Teutonic race does
3284: not produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say
3285: that she was much "disappointed" at the moderate number and size of our
3286: fat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a
3287: stranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually
3288: plump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young. But how
3289: was he to know this? Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be
3290: corrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct
3291: experience of eye and ear is often powerless. And I could perceive that
3292: Ganymede's inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been
3293: stronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely
3294: optical phenomena of the looking-glass. He now held a post under
3295: Government, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how
3296: ill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high
3297: constructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own
3298: speeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his
3299: department, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head
3300: voice and saying--
3301: 
3302: "But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can
3303: only get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been
3304: drawn the name is sure to creep out. The writer is known to be young,
3305: and things are none the forwarder."
3306: 
3307: "Well," said I, "youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish.
3308: You and I have seven years less of it than when we last met."
3309: 
3310: "Ah?" returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time
3311: casting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of
3312: seven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,
3313: and even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant
3314: doctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies.
3315: 
3316: I left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his
3317: illusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up. I saw that he was
3318: well victualled and defended against a ten years' siege from ruthless
3319: facts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his
3320: resistance received considerable aid from without. Each of his written
3321: productions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a
3322: very young man. One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably
3323: referred to his youth as an excuse. Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,
3324: seemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors
3325: appeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked
3326: for from gentlemen of the old school. Able pens (according to a familiar
3327: metaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that
3328: Ganymede's crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young. Such
3329: unanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for
3330: evidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no
3331: mistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the
3332: prevalence of cotton in our fabrics. Ganymede had been first introduced
3333: into the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional
3334: consequence that the first deposit of information about him held its
3335: ground against facts which, however open to observation, were not
3336: necessarily thought of. It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and
3337: need for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark
3338: that turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine
3339: substitutes. There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an
3340: epithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author
3341: of the 'Comparative Estimate' heard the echoes repeating "Young
3342: Ganymede" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have
3343: given him forty years at least. Besides, important elders, sachems of
3344: the clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young
3345: enough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken
3346: mistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting
3347: of his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a
3348: presumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a
3349: speedy baldness could have removed.
3350: 
3351: It is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede's
3352: illusion, which shows no signs of leaving him. It is true that he no
3353: longer hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first
3354: introduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence
3355: has become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion. His
3356: manners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on
3357: others, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of
3358: the young genius. As to the incongruity of his contour and other little
3359: accidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will
3360: affect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her
3361: rouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention
3362: sarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with
3363: affectionate reverence.
3364: 
3365: But let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs
3366: as well as old-young coquettes.

3373: 
3374: HOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM.
3375: 
3376: It is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any
3377: absurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in
3378: myself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain
3379: correspondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the
3380: natural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in
3381: opposite zones. No doubt men's minds differ in what we may call their
3382: climate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is
3383: comparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than
3384: that of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which
3385: the very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in
3386: which a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in
3387: which your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty
3388: miniature suitable for fancy potting. The eccentric man might be
3389: typified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious
3390: assumptions of what nature allows. Still, whether fate commanded us to
3391: thatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in
3392: tattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison
3393: would teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further
3394: knowledge would be resemblance to what we already know. Hence, having a
3395: keen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this
3396: plan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by
3397: which I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in
3398: his least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous
3399: deduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen
3400: which I myself furnish.
3401: 
3402: Introspection which starts with the purpose of finding out one's own
3403: absurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is
3404: not free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions
3405: that keep us alive and active. To judge of others by oneself is in its
3406: most innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of
3407: knowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases
3408: either the vulgar mistake which reduces every man's value to the very
3409: low figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the
3410: amiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous
3411: construction of the lower. One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:
3412: it resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the
3413: myriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can
3414: give. The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one
3415: observes in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and
3416: keenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the
3417: energies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of
3418: wrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the
3419: wholesome restraining power of public opinion. I respect the horsewhip
3420: when applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is
3421: a more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not
3422: checked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more
3423: perfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best
3424: social life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that
3425: nullify action. This is the essence of Dante's sentiment (it is painful
3426: to think that he applies it very cruelly)--
3427: 
3428:   "E cortesia fù, lui esser villano"[1]--
3429: 
3430: and it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one's kinship
3431: with all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles
3432: against wrong.
3433: 
3434: But certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at
3435: present be very threatening. One could not fairly describe the
3436: generality of one's neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in
3437: their own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her
3438: Majesty's subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of
3439: Providence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to
3440: correct another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick
3441: which he himself possesses. Doubtless philosophers will be able to
3442: explain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of
3443: the _à priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect
3444: anything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be
3445: disgusted at Laura's attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she
3446: recognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that
3447: Semper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on
3448: platforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad
3449: time for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark
3450: pitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in
3451: Ubique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and
3452: for every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,
3453: should deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not
3454: perceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him.
3455: To be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental
3456: blemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling
3457: fact is that people should apparently take no account of their
3458: deliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by
3459: others. It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the
3460: phrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested
3461: sentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is
3462: taken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation
3463: which contradicts it. The thief making a vow to heaven of full
3464: restitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat
3465: Omniscience by an "aside," is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies
3466: and gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in
3467: their own statement about their habitual doings than in the
3468: contradictory fact which is patent in the daylight. One reason of the
3469: absurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that
3470: long after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he
3471: continues innocently to state it as a true description of his
3472: practice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old
3473: gentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself
3474: called by an epithet which he has only applied to others.
3475: 
3476: [Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii. 150.]
3477: 
3478: "A person with your tendency of constitution should take as little sugar
3479: as possible," said Pilulus to Bovis somewhere in the darker decades of
3480: this century. "It has made a great difference to Avis since he took my
3481: advice in that matter: he used to consume half a pound a-day."
3482: 
3483: "God bless me!" cries Bovis. "I take very little sugar myself."
3484: 
3485: "Twenty-six large lumps every day of your life, Mr Bovis," says his
3486: wife.
3487: 
3488: "No such thing!" exclaims Bovis.
3489: 
3490: "You drop them into your tea, coffee, and whisky yourself, my dear, and
3491: I count them."
3492: 
3493: "Nonsense!" laughs Bovis, turning to Pilulus, that they may exchange a
3494: glance of mutual amusement at a woman's inaccuracy.
3495: 
3496: But she happened to be right. Bovis had never said inwardly that he
3497: would take a large allowance of sugar, and he had the tradition about
3498: himself that he was a man of the most moderate habits; hence, with this
3499: conviction, he was naturally disgusted at the saccharine excesses of
3500: Avis.
3501: 
3502: I have sometimes thought that this facility of men in believing that
3503: they are still what they once meant to be--this undisturbed
3504: appropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy
3505: relic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to
3506: soberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a tippler whom the need
3507: of a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the
3508: turpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood. It is notorious
3509: that a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till
3510: he at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the
3511: very first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a
3512: reproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all
3513: evidence? There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent.
3514: 
3515: When we come to examine in detail what is the sane mind in the sane
3516: body, the final test of completeness seems to be a security of
3517: distinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what
3518: we have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and
3519: what we have witnessed or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in
3520: the present and what we thought and felt in the past.
3521: 
3522: I know that there is a common prejudice which regards the habitual
3523: confusion of _now_ and _then_, of _it was_ and _it is_, of _it seemed
3524: so_ and _I should like it to be so_, as a mark of high imaginative
3525: endowment, while the power of precise statement and description is rated
3526: lower, as the attitude of an everyday prosaic mind. High imagination is
3527: often assigned or claimed as if it were a ready activity in fabricating
3528: extravagances such as are presented by fevered dreams, or as if its
3529: possessors were in that state of inability to give credible testimony
3530: which would warrant their exclusion from the class of acceptable
3531: witnesses in a court of justice; so that a creative genius might fairly
3532: be subjected to the disability which some laws have stamped on dicers,
3533: slaves, and other classes whose position was held perverting to their
3534: sense of social responsibility.
3535: 
3536: This endowment of mental confusion is often boasted of by persons whose
3537: imaginativeness would not otherwise be known, unless it were by the slow
3538: process of detecting that their descriptions and narratives were not to
3539: be trusted. Callista is always ready to testify of herself that she is
3540: an imaginative person, and sometimes adds in illustration, that if she
3541: had taken a walk and seen an old heap of stones on her way, the account
3542: she would give on returning would include many pleasing particulars of
3543: her own invention, transforming the simple heap into an interesting
3544: castellated ruin. This creative freedom is all very well in the right
3545: place, but before I can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power, I
3546: must inquire whether, on being requested to give a precise description
3547: of what she saw, she would be able to cast aside her arbitrary
3548: combinations and recover the objects she really perceived so as to make
3549: them recognisable by another person who passed the same way. Otherwise
3550: her glorifying imagination is not an addition to the fundamental power
3551: of strong, discerning perception, but a cheaper substitute. And, in
3552: fact, I find on listening to Callista's conversation, that she has a
3553: very lax conception even of common objects, and an equally lax memory of
3554: events. It seems of no consequence to her whether she shall say that a
3555: stone is overgrown with moss or with lichen, that a building is of
3556: sandstone or of granite, that Meliboeus once forgot to put on his cravat
3557: or that he always appears without it; that everybody says so, or that
3558: one stock-broker's wife said so yesterday; that Philemon praised
3559: Euphemia up to the skies, or that he denied knowing any particular evil
3560: of her. She is one of those respectable witnesses who would testify to
3561: the exact moment of an apparition, because any desirable moment will be
3562: as exact as another to her remembrance; or who would be the most worthy
3563: to witness the action of spirits on slates and tables because the action
3564: of limbs would not probably arrest her attention. She would describe the
3565: surprising phenomena exhibited by the powerful Medium with the same
3566: freedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stones. Her
3567: supposed imaginativeness is simply a very usual lack of discriminating
3568: perception, accompanied with a less usual activity of misrepresentation,
3569: which, if it had been a little more intense, or had been stimulated by
3570: circumstance, might have made her a profuse writer unchecked by the
3571: troublesome need of veracity.
3572: 
3573: These characteristics are the very opposite of such as yield a fine
3574: imagination, which is always based on a keen vision, a keen
3575: consciousness of what _is_, and carries the store of definite knowledge
3576: as material for the construction of its inward visions. Witness Dante,
3577: who is at once the most precise and homely in his reproduction of actual
3578: objects, and the most soaringly at large in his imaginative
3579: combinations. On a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and
3580: rapid development in descriptions of persons and events which are lit up
3581: by humorous intention in the speaker--we distinguish this charming play
3582: of intelligence which resembles musical improvisation on a given motive,
3583: where the farthest sweep of curve is looped into relevancy by an
3584: instinctive method, from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration
3585: which is really something commoner than the correct simplicity often
3586: depreciated as prosaic.
3587: 
3588: Even if high imagination were to be identified with illusion, there
3589: would be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of
3590: illusion which is informed by industrious submissive observation and the
3591: trumpery stage-property illusion which depends on the ill-defined
3592: impressions gathered by capricious inclination, as there is between a
3593: good and a bad picture of the Last Judgment. In both these the subject
3594: is a combination never actually witnessed, and in the good picture the
3595: general combination may be of surpassing boldness; but on examination it
3596: is seen that the separate elements have been closely studied from real
3597: objects. And even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong
3598: drawing and fantastic colour, the charm is dependent on the selective
3599: sensibility of the painter to certain real delicacies of form which
3600: confer the expression he longed to render; for apart from this basis of
3601: an effect perceived in common, there could be no conveyance of aesthetic
3602: meaning by the painter to the beholder. In this sense it is as true to
3603: say of Fra Angelico's Coronation of the Virgin, that it has a strain of
3604: reality, as to say so of a portrait by Rembrandt, which also has its
3605: strain of ideal elevation due to Rembrandt's virile selective
3606: sensibility. To correct such self-flatterers as Callista, it is worth
3607: repeating that powerful imagination is not false outward vision, but
3608: intense inward representation, and a creative energy constantly fed by
3609: susceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience, which it
3610: reproduces and constructs in fresh and fresh wholes; not the habitual
3611: confusion of provable fact with the fictions of fancy and transient
3612: inclination, but a breadth of ideal association which informs every
3613: material object, every incidental fact with far-reaching memories and
3614: stored residues of passion, bringing into new light the less obvious
3615: relations of human existence. The illusion to which it is liable is not
3616: that of habitually taking duck-ponds for lilied pools, but of being more
3617: or less transiently and in varying degrees so absorbed in ideal vision
3618: as to lose the consciousness of surrounding objects or occurrences; and
3619: when that rapt condition is past, the sane genius discriminates clearly
3620: between what has been given in this parenthetic state of excitement, and
3621: what he has known, and may count on, in the ordinary world of
3622: experience. Dante seems to have expressed these conditions perfectly in
3623: that passage of the _Purgatorio_ where, after a triple vision which has
3624: made him forget his surroundings, he says--
3625: 
3626:   "Quando l'anima mia tornò di fuori
3627:     Alle cose che son fuor di lei vere,
3628:     Io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori."--(c xv.)
3629: 
3630: He distinguishes the ideal truth of his entranced vision from the series
3631: of external facts to which his consciousness had returned. Isaiah gives
3632: us the date of his vision in the Temple--"the year that King Uzziah
3633: died"--and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraphim were present with
3634: him as he trod the street, he doubtless knew them for images of memory,
3635: and did not cry "Look!" to the passers-by.
3636: 
3637: Certainly the seer, whether prophet, philosopher, scientific discoverer,
3638: or poet, may happen to be rather mad: his powers may have been used up,
3639: like Don Quixote's, in their visionary or theoretic constructions, so
3640: that the reports of common-sense fail to affect him, or the continuous
3641: strain of excitement may have robbed his mind of its elasticity. It is
3642: hard for our frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with
3643: steady gait and full alacrity of perception. But he is the strongest
3644: seer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that
3645: sanity of expectation which consists in distinguishing, as Dante does,
3646: between the _cose che son vere_ outside the individual mind, and the
3647: _non falsi errori_ which are the revelations of true imaginative power.

3655: THE TOO READY WRITER
3656: 
3657: One who talks too much, hindering the rest of the company from taking
3658: their turn, and apparently seeing no reason why they should not rather
3659: desire to know his opinion or experience in relation to all subjects, or
3660: at least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no
3661: figure, has never been praised for this industrious monopoly of work
3662: which others would willingly have shared in. However various and
3663: brilliant his talk may be, we suspect him of impoverishing us by
3664: excluding the contributions of other minds, which attract our curiosity
3665: the more because he has shut them up in silence. Besides, we get tired
3666: of a "manner" in conversation as in painting, when one theme after
3667: another is treated with the same lines and touches. I begin with a
3668: liking for an estimable master, but by the time he has stretched his
3669: interpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery, I have
3670: had what the cautious Scotch mind would call "enough" of him. There is
3671: monotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity; what comes
3672: to me from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment
3673: of any single interpreter. On this ground even a modest person, without
3674: power or will to shine in the conversation, may easily find the
3675: predominating talker a nuisance, while those who are full of matter on
3676: special topics are continually detecting miserably thin places in the
3677: web of that information which he will not desist from imparting. Nobody
3678: that I know of ever proposed a testimonial to a man for thus
3679: volunteering the whole expense of the conversation.
3680: 
3681: Why is there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer
3682: who plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays
3683: in what is traditionally called conversation? The busy Adrastus, whose
3684: professional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous
3685: energy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief
3686: current subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the
3687: Infinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the Colorado beetle and the
3688: grape disease in the south of France, is generally praised if not
3689: admired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of
3690: work. Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he
3691: has given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously
3692: from month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a
3693: place in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary,
3694: regularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the
3695: copious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated
3696: trade-mark. Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the
3697: shortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to
3698: discussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in
3699: conversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in
3700: print? The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and
3701: there is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other
3702: fellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering
3703: themselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over
3704: it the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four "mediums" at
3705: once, and on subjects taken from the four winds. Such restless and
3706: versatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier
3707: when the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this
3708: knowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and
3709: conjecture. They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a
3710: Vincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything
3711: themselves would have been strictly in place. In the present day, the
3712: busy retailer of other people's knowledge which he has spoiled in the
3713: handling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker
3714: of undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises
3715: early in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or
3716: makes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what
3717: nobody ever believed, is not simply "gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil
3718: agens"--he is an obstruction. Like an incompetent architect with too
3719: much interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where
3720: place ought to have been left to better men.
3721: 
3722: Is it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about
3723: mixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with
3724: that of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our
3725: flavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been
3726: already given by somebody else. What if we were only like the Spanish
3727: wine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the
3728: Spanish grape has naturally a taste of leather? One could wish that even
3729: the greatest minds should leave some themes unhandled, or at least leave
3730: us no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in
3731: not being more lengthy.
3732: 
3733: Such entertainment of scruple can hardly be expected from the young; but
3734: happily their readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of
3735: mankind is not encouraged by easy publicity. In the vivacious Pepin I
3736: have often seen the image of my early youth, when it seemed to me
3737: astonishing that the philosophers had left so many difficulties
3738: unsolved, and that so many great themes had raised no great poet to
3739: treat them. I had an elated sense that I should find my brain full of
3740: theoretic clues when I looked for them, and that wherever a poet had not
3741: done what I expected, it was for want of my insight. Not knowing what
3742: had been said about the play of Romeo and Juliet, I felt myself capable
3743: of writing something original on its blemishes and beauties. In relation
3744: to all subjects I had a joyous consciousness of that ability which is
3745: prior to knowledge, and of only needing to apply myself in order to
3746: master any task--to conciliate philosophers whose systems were at
3747: present but dimly known to me, to estimate foreign poets whom I had not
3748: yet read, to show up mistakes in an historical monograph that roused my
3749: interest in an epoch which I had been hitherto ignorant of, when I
3750: should once have had time to verify my views of probability by looking
3751: into an encyclopaedia. So Pepin; save only that he is industrious while
3752: I was idle. Like the astronomer in Rasselas, I swayed the universe in my
3753: consciousness without making any difference outside me; whereas Pepin,
3754: while feeling himself powerful with the stars in their courses, really
3755: raises some dust here below. He is no longer in his spring-tide, but
3756: having been always busy he has been obliged to use his first impressions
3757: as if they were deliberate opinions, and to range himself on the
3758: corresponding side in ignorance of much that he commits himself to; so
3759: that he retains some characteristics of a comparatively tender age, and
3760: among them a certain surprise that there have not been more persons
3761: equal to himself. Perhaps it is unfortunate for him that he early gained
3762: a hearing, or at least a place in print, and was thus encouraged in
3763: acquiring a fixed habit of writing, to the exclusion of any other
3764: bread-winning pursuit. He is already to be classed as a "general
3765: writer," corresponding to the comprehensive wants of the "general
3766: reader," and with this industry on his hands it is not enough for him to
3767: keep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth: he finds himself under an
3768: obligation to be skilled in various methods of seeming to know; and
3769: having habitually expressed himself before he was convinced, his
3770: interest in all subjects is chiefly to ascertain that he has not made a
3771: mistake, and to feel his infallibility confirmed. That impulse to
3772: decide, that vague sense of being able to achieve the unattempted, that
3773: dream of aerial unlimited movement at will without feet or wings, which
3774: were once but the joyous mounting of young sap, are already taking shape
3775: as unalterable woody fibre: the impulse has hardened into "style," and
3776: into a pattern of peremptory sentences; the sense of ability in the
3777: presence of other men's failures is turning into the official arrogance
3778: of one who habitually issues directions which he has never himself been
3779: called on to execute; the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling has taken on
3780: a fatal sort of reality in written pretensions which carry consequences.
3781: He is on the way to become like the loud-buzzing, bouncing Bombus who
3782: combines conceited illusions enough to supply several patients in a
3783: lunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various
3784: forms of print. If one who takes himself for the telegraphic centre of
3785: all American wires is to be confined as unfit to transact affairs, what
3786: shall we say to the man who believes himself in possession of the
3787: unexpressed motives and designs dwelling in the breasts of all
3788: sovereigns and all politicians? And I grieve to think that poor Pepin,
3789: though less political, may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more
3790: sane, for he is beginning to explain people's writing by what he does
3791: not know about them. Yet he was once at the comparatively innocent stage
3792: which I have confessed to be that of my own early astonishment at my
3793: powerful originality; and copying the just humility of the old Puritan,
3794: I may say, "But for the grace of discouragement, this coxcombry might
3795: have been mine."
3796: 
3797: Pepin made for himself a necessity of writing (and getting printed)
3798: before he had considered whether he had the knowledge or belief that
3799: would furnish eligible matter. At first perhaps the necessity galled him
3800: a little, but it is now as easily borne, nay, is as irrepressible a
3801: habit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk. He is gradually being
3802: condemned to have no genuine impressions, no direct consciousness of
3803: enjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what is before him: his
3804: perceptions are continually arranging themselves in forms suitable to a
3805: printed judgment, and hence they will often turn out to be as much to
3806: the purpose if they are written without any direct contemplation of the
3807: object, and are guided by a few external conditions which serve to
3808: classify it for him. In this way he is irrevocably losing the faculty of
3809: accurate mental vision: having bound himself to express judgments which
3810: will satisfy some other demands than that of veracity, he has blunted
3811: his perceptions by continual preoccupation. We cannot command veracity
3812: at will: the power of seeing and reporting truly is a form of health
3813: that has to be delicately guarded, and as an ancient Rabbi has solemnly
3814: said, "The penalty of untruth is untruth." But Pepin is only a mild
3815: example of the fact that incessant writing with a view to printing
3816: carries internal consequences which have often the nature of disease.
3817: And however unpractical it may be held to consider whether we have
3818: anything to print which it is good for the world to read, or which has
3819: not been better said before, it will perhaps be allowed to be worth
3820: considering what effect the printing may have on ourselves. Clearly
3821: there is a sort of writing which helps to keep the writer in a
3822: ridiculously contented ignorance; raising in him continually the sense
3823: of having delivered himself effectively, so that the acquirement of more
3824: thorough knowledge seems as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a
3825: past occasion. He has invested his vanity (perhaps his hope of income)
3826: in his own shallownesses and mistakes, and must desire their prosperity.
3827: Like the professional prophet, he learns to be glad of the harm that
3828: keeps up his credit, and to be sorry for the good that contradicts him.
3829: It is hard enough for any of us, amid the changing winds of fortune and
3830: the hurly-burly of events, to keep quite clear of a gladness which is
3831: another's calamity; but one may choose not to enter on a course which
3832: will turn such gladness into a fixed habit of mind, committing ourselves
3833: to be continually pleased that others should appear to be wrong in order
3834: that we may have the air of being right.
3835: 
3836: In some cases, perhaps, it might be urged that Pepin has remained the
3837: more self-contented because he has _not_ written everything he believed
3838: himself capable of. He once asked me to read a sort of programme of the
3839: species of romance which he should think it worth while to write--a
3840: species which he contrasted in strong terms with the productions of
3841: illustrious but overrated authors in this branch. Pepin's romance was to
3842: present the splendours of the Roman Empire at the culmination of its
3843: grandeur, when decadence was spiritually but not visibly imminent: it
3844: was to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and
3845: exalted of human circumstances, the designs of statesmen, the
3846: interfusion of philosophies, the rural relaxation and converse of
3847: immortal poets, the majestic triumphs of warriors, the mingling of the
3848: quaint and sublime in religious ceremony, the gorgeous delirium of
3849: gladiatorial shows, and under all the secretly working leaven of
3850: Christianity. Such a romance would not call the attention of society to
3851: the dialect of stable-boys, the low habits of rustics, the vulgarity of
3852: small schoolmasters, the manners of men in livery, or to any other form
3853: of uneducated talk and sentiments: its characters would have virtues and
3854: vices alike on the grand scale, and would express themselves in an
3855: English representing the discourse of the most powerful minds in the
3856: best Latin, or possibly Greek, when there occurred a scene with a Greek
3857: philosopher on a visit to Rome or resident there as a teacher. In this
3858: way Pepin would do in fiction what had never been done before: something
3859: not at all like 'Rienzi' or 'Notre Dame de Paris,' or any other attempt
3860: of that kind; but something at once more penetrating and more
3861: magnificent, more passionate and more philosophical, more panoramic yet
3862: more select: something that would present a conception of a gigantic
3863: period; in short something truly Roman and world-historical.
3864: 
3865: When Pepin gave me this programme to read he was much younger than at
3866: present. Some slight success in another vein diverted him from the
3867: production of panoramic and select romance, and the experience of not
3868: having tried to carry out his programme has naturally made him more
3869: biting and sarcastic on the failures of those who have actually written
3870: romances without apparently having had a glimpse of a conception equal
3871: to his. Indeed, I am often comparing his rather touchingly inflated
3872: _naïveté_ as of a small young person walking on tiptoe while he is
3873: talking of elevated things, at the time when he felt himself the author
3874: of that unwritten romance, with his present epigrammatic curtness and
3875: affectation of power kept strictly in reserve. His paragraphs now seem
3876: to have a bitter smile in them, from the consciousness of a mind too
3877: penetrating to accept any other man's ideas, and too equally competent
3878: in all directions to seclude his power in any one form of creation, but
3879: rather fitted to hang over them all as a lamp of guidance to the
3880: stumblers below. You perceive how proud he is of not being indebted to
3881: any writer: even with the dead he is on the creditor's side, for he is
3882: doing them the service of letting the world know what they meant better
3883: than those poor pre-Pepinians themselves had any means of doing, and he
3884: treats the mighty shades very cavalierly.
3885: 
3886: Is this fellow-citizen of ours, considered simply in the light of a
3887: baptised Christian and tax-paying Englishman, really as madly
3888: conceited, as empty of reverential feeling, as unveracious and careless
3889: of justice, as full of catch-penny devices and stagey attitudinising as
3890: on examination his writing shows itself to be? By no means. He has
3891: arrived at his present pass in "the literary calling" through the
3892: self-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the
3893: impression of superior knowledge and ability. He is much worthier and
3894: more admirable than his written productions, because the moral aspects
3895: exhibited in his writing are felt to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the
3896: personal relations of life. In blaming Pepin's writing we are accusing
3897: the public conscience, which is so lax and ill informed on the momentous
3898: bearings of authorship that it sanctions the total absence of scruple in
3899: undertaking and prosecuting what should be the best warranted of
3900: vocations.
3901: 
3902: Hence I still accept friendly relations with Pepin, for he has much
3903: private amiability, and though he probably thinks of me as a man of
3904: slender talents, without rapidity of _coup d'oeil_ and with no
3905: compensatory penetration, he meets me very cordially, and would not, I
3906: am sure, willingly pain me in conversation by crudely declaring his low
3907: estimate of my capacity. Yet I have often known him to insult my betters
3908: and contribute (perhaps unreflectingly) to encourage injurious
3909: conceptions of them--but that was done in the course of his professional
3910: writing, and the public conscience still leaves such writing nearly on
3911: the level of the Merry-Andrew's dress, which permits an impudent
3912: deportment and extraordinary gambols to one who in his ordinary clothing
3913: shows himself the decent father of a family.

3919: 
3920: 
3921: DISEASES OF SMALL AUTHORSHIP
3922: 
3923: Particular callings, it is known, encourage particular diseases. There
3924: is a painter's colic: the Sheffield grinder falls a victim to the
3925: inhalation of steel dust: clergymen so often have a certain kind of sore
3926: throat that this otherwise secular ailment gets named after them. And
3927: perhaps, if we were to inquire, we should find a similar relation
3928: between certain moral ailments and these various occupations, though
3929: here in the case of clergymen there would be specific differences: the
3930: poor curate, equally with the rector, is liable to clergyman's sore
3931: throat, but he would probably be found free from the chronic moral
3932: ailments encouraged by the possession of glebe and those higher chances
3933: of preferment which follow on having a good position already. On the
3934: other hand, the poor curate might have severe attacks of calculating
3935: expectancy concerning parishioners' turkeys, cheeses, and fat geese, or
3936: of uneasy rivalry for the donations of clerical charities.
3937: 
3938: Authors are so miscellaneous a class that
3939: their personified diseases, physical and moral,
3940: might include the whole procession of human
3941: disorders, led by dyspepsia and ending in
3942: madness--the awful Dumb Show of a world-historic
3943: tragedy. Take a large enough area
3944: of human life and all comedy melts into
3945: tragedy, like the Fool's part by the side of
3946: Lear. The chief scenes get filled with erring
3947: heroes, guileful usurpers, persecuted discoverers,
3948: dying deliverers: everywhere the
3949: protagonist has a part pregnant with doom.
3950: The comedy sinks to an accessory, and if there
3951: are loud laughs they seem a convulsive transition
3952: from sobs; or if the comedy is touched
3953: with a gentle lovingness, the panoramic scene
3954: is one where
3955: 
3956:         "Sadness is a kind of mirth
3957:   So mingled as if mirth did make us sad
3958:   And sadness merry."[1]
3959: 
3960: [Footnote 1: Two Noble Kinsmen.]
3961: 
3962: But I did not set out on the wide survey that would carry me into
3963: tragedy, and in fact had nothing more serious in my mind than certain
3964: small chronic ailments that come of small authorship. I was thinking
3965: principally of Vorticella, who flourished in my youth not only as a
3966: portly lady walking in silk attire, but also as the authoress of a book
3967: entitled 'The Channel Islands, with Notes and an Appendix.' I would by
3968: no means make it a reproach to her that she wrote no more than one book;
3969: on the contrary, her stopping there seems to me a laudable example. What
3970: one would have wished, after experience, was that she had refrained from
3971: producing even that single volume, and thus from giving her
3972: self-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which became
3973: oppressive to her acquaintances, and set up in herself one of those
3974: slight chronic forms of disease to which I have just referred. She lived
3975: in the considerable provincial town of Pumpiter, which had its own
3976: newspaper press, with the usual divisions of political partisanship and
3977: the usual varieties of literary criticism--the florid and allusive, the
3978: _staccato_ and peremptory, the clairvoyant and prophetic, the safe and
3979: pattern-phrased, or what one might call "the many-a-long-day style."
3980: 
3981: Vorticella being the wife of an important townsman had naturally the
3982: satisfaction of seeing 'The Channel Islands' reviewed by all the organs
3983: of Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally
3984: the opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the
3985: reception of "critical opinions." This ornamental volume lay on a
3986: special table in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously
3987: bound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was
3988: allowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and
3989: her work in the 'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,' the 'Pumpshire
3990: Post,' the 'Church Clock,' the 'Independent Monitor,' and the lively but
3991: judicious publication known as the 'Medley Pie;' to be followed up, if
3992: he chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory
3993: judgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from
3994: the most distant counties; as the 'Latchgate Argus,' the Penllwy
3995: Universe,' the 'Cockaleekie Advertiser,' the 'Goodwin Sands Opinion,'
3996: and the 'Land's End Times.'
3997: 
3998: I had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there. When
3999: I called on Vorticella, who had a cousinship with my hosts, she had to
4000: excuse herself because a message claimed her attention for eight or ten
4001: minutes, and handing me the album of critical opinions said, with a
4002: certain emphasis which, considering my youth, was highly complimentary,
4003: that she would really like me to read what I should find there. This
4004: seemed a permissive politeness which I could not feel to be an
4005: oppression, and I ran my eyes over the dozen pages, each with a strip or
4006: islet of newspaper in the centre, with that freedom of mind (in my case
4007: meaning freedom to forget) which would be a perilous way of preparing
4008: for examination. This _ad libitum_ perusal had its interest for me. The
4009: private truth being that I had not read 'The Channel Islands,' I was
4010: amazed at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have
4011: impressed these different judges with the writer's surpassing capacity
4012: to handle almost all branches of inquiry and all forms of presentation.
4013: In Jersey she had shown herself an historian, in Guernsey a poetess, in
4014: Alderney a political economist, and in Sark a humorist: there were
4015: sketches of character scattered through the pages which might put our
4016: "fictionists" to the blush; the style was eloquent and racy, studded
4017: with gems of felicitous remark; and the moral spirit throughout was so
4018: superior that, said one, "the recording angel" (who is not supposed to
4019: take account of literature as such) "would assuredly set down the work
4020: as a deed of religion." The force of this eulogy on the part of several
4021: reviewers was much heightened by the incidental evidence of their
4022: fastidious and severe taste, which seemed to suffer considerably from
4023: the imperfections of our chief writers, even the dead and canonised: one
4024: afflicted them with the smell of oil, another lacked erudition and
4025: attempted (though vainly) to dazzle them with trivial conceits, one
4026: wanted to be more philosophical than nature had made him, another in
4027: attempting to be comic produced the melancholy effect of a half-starved
4028: Merry-Andrew; while one and all, from the author of the 'Areopagitica'
4029: downwards, had faults of style which must have made an able hand in the
4030: 'Latchgate Argus' shake the many-glanced head belonging thereto with a
4031: smile of compassionate disapproval. Not so the authoress of 'The Channel
4032: Islands:' Vorticella and Shakspere were allowed to be faultless. I
4033: gathered that no blemishes were observable in the work of this
4034: accomplished writer, and the repeated information that she was "second
4035: to none" seemed after this superfluous. Her thick octavo--notes,
4036: appendix and all--was unflagging from beginning to end; and the 'Land's
4037: End Times,' using a rather dangerous rhetorical figure, recommended you
4038: not to take up the volume unless you had leisure to finish it at a
4039: sitting. It had given one writer more pleasure than he had had for many
4040: a long day--a sentence which had a melancholy resonance, suggesting a
4041: life of studious languor such as all previous achievements of the human
4042: mind failed to stimulate into enjoyment. I think the collection of
4043: critical opinions wound up with this sentence, and I had turned back to
4044: look at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which fronted the first
4045: page of the album, when the fair original re-entered and I laid down the
4046: volume on its appropriate table.
4047: 
4048: "Well, what do you think of them?" said Vorticella, with an emphasis
4049: which had some significance unperceived by me. "I know you are a great
4050: student. Give me _your_ opinion of these opinions."
4051: 
4052: "They must be very gratifying to you," I answered with a little
4053: confusion, for I perceived that I might easily mistake my footing, and I
4054: began to have a presentiment of an examination for which I was by no
4055: means crammed.
4056: 
4057: "On the whole--yes," said Vorticella, in a tone of concession. "A few of
4058: the notices are written with some pains, but not one of them has really
4059: grappled with the chief idea in the appendix. I don't know whether you
4060: have studied political economy, but you saw what I said on page 398
4061: about the Jersey fisheries?"
4062: 
4063: I bowed--I confess it--with the mean hope that this movement in the nape
4064: of my neck would be taken as sufficient proof that I had read, marked,
4065: and learned. I do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood, but
4066: I was young and morally timorous, and Vorticella's personality had an
4067: effect on me something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he
4068: directs all his ten fingers towards your eyes, as unpleasantly visible
4069: ducts for the invisible stream. I felt a great power of contempt in her,
4070: if I did not come up to her expectations.
4071: 
4072: "Well," she resumed, "you observe that not one of them has taken up that
4073: argument. But I hope I convinced you about the drag-nets?"
4074: 
4075: Here was a judgment on me. Orientally speaking, I had lifted up my foot
4076: on the steep descent of falsity and was compelled to set it down on a
4077: lower level. "I should think you must be right," said I, inwardly
4078: resolving that on the next topic I would tell the truth.
4079: 
4080: "I _know_ that I am right," said Vorticella. "The fact is that no critic
4081: in this town is fit to meddle with such subjects, unless it be Volvox,
4082: and he, with all his command of language, is very superficial. It is
4083: Volvox who writes in the 'Monitor,' I hope you noticed how he
4084: contradicts himself?"
4085: 
4086: My resolution, helped by the equivalence of dangers, stoutly prevailed,
4087: and I said, "No."
4088: 
4089: "No! I am surprised. He is the only one who finds fault with me. He is
4090: a Dissenter, you know. The 'Monitor' is the Dissenters' organ, but my
4091: husband has been so useful to them in municipal affairs that they would
4092: not venture to run my book down; they feel obliged to tell the truth
4093: about me. Still Volvox betrays himself. After praising me for my
4094: penetration and accuracy, he presently says I have allowed myself to be
4095: imposed upon and have let my active imagination run away with me. That
4096: is like his dissenting impertinence. Active my imagination may be, but I
4097: have it under control. Little Vibrio, who writes the playful notice in
4098: the 'Medley Pie,' has a clever hit at Volvox in that passage about the
4099: steeplechase of imagination, where the loser wants to make it appear
4100: that the winner was only run away with. But if you did not notice
4101: Volvox's self-contradiction you would not see the point," added
4102: Vorticella, with rather a chilling intonation. "Or perhaps you did not
4103: read the 'Medley Pie' notice? That is a pity. Do take up the book again.
4104: Vibrio is a poor little tippling creature, but, as Mr Carlyle would say,
4105: he has an eye, and he is always lively."
4106: 
4107: I did take up the book again, and read as demanded.
4108: 
4109: "It is very ingenious," said I, really appreciating the difficulty of
4110: being lively in this connection: it seemed even more wonderful than that
4111: a Vibrio should have an eye.
4112: 
4113: "You are probably surprised to see no notices from the London press,"
4114: said Vorticella. "I have one--a very remarkable one. But I reserve it
4115: until the others have spoken, and then I shall introduce it to wind up.
4116: I shall have them reprinted, of course, and inserted in future copies.
4117: This from the 'Candelabrum' is only eight lines in length, but full of
4118: venom. It calls my style dull and pompous. I think that will tell its
4119: own tale, placed after the other critiques."
4120: 
4121: "People's impressions are so different," said I. "Some persons find 'Don
4122: Quixote' dull."
4123: 
4124: "Yes," said Vorticella, in emphatic chest tones, "dulness is a matter of
4125: opinion; but pompous! That I never was and never could be. Perhaps he
4126: means that my matter is too important for his taste; and I have no
4127: objection to _that_. I did not intend to be trivial. I should just like
4128: to read you that passage about the drag-nets, because I could make it
4129: clearer to you."
4130: 
4131: A second (less ornamental) copy was at her elbow and was already opened,
4132: when to my great relief another guest was announced, and I was able to
4133: take my leave without seeming to run away from 'The Channel Islands,'
4134: though not without being compelled to carry with me the loan of "the
4135: marked copy," which I was to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the
4136: appendix, and was only requested to return before my departure from
4137: Pumpiter. Looking into the volume now with some curiosity, I found it a
4138: very ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious, one of those
4139: books which one might imagine to have been written under the old Grub
4140: Street coercion of hunger and thirst, if they were not known beforehand
4141: to be the gratuitous productions of ladies and gentlemen whose
4142: circumstances might be called altogether easy, but for an uneasy vanity
4143: that happened to have been directed towards authorship. Its importance
4144: was that of a polypus, tumour, fungus, or other erratic outgrowth,
4145: noxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which
4146: nourishes it. Poor Vorticella might not have been more wearisome on a
4147: visit than the majority of her neighbours, but for this disease of
4148: magnified self-importance belonging to small authorship. I understand
4149: that the chronic complaint of 'The Channel Islands' never left her. As
4150: the years went on and the publication tended to vanish in the distance
4151: for her neighbours' memory, she was still bent on dragging it to the
4152: foreground, and her chief interest in new acquaintances was the
4153: possibility of lending them her book, entering into all details
4154: concerning it, and requesting them to read her album of "critical
4155: opinions." This really made her more tiresome than Gregarina, whose
4156: distinction was that she had had cholera, and who did not feel herself
4157: in her true position with strangers until they knew it.
4158: 
4159: My experience with Vorticella led me for a time into the false
4160: supposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration, which makes Self
4161: disagreeably larger, was most common to the female sex; but I presently
4162: found that here too the male could assert his superiority and show a
4163: more vigorous boredom. I have known a man with a single pamphlet
4164: containing an assurance that somebody else was wrong, together with a
4165: few approved quotations, produce a more powerful effect of shuddering at
4166: his approach than ever Vorticella did with her varied octavo volume,
4167: including notes and appendix. Males of more than one nation recur to my
4168: memory who produced from their pocket on the slightest encouragement a
4169: small pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet, wrapped in silver paper, as a
4170: present held ready for an intelligent reader. "A mode of propagandism,"
4171: you remark in excuse; "they wished to spread some useful corrective
4172: doctrine." Not necessarily: the indoctrination aimed at was perhaps to
4173: convince you of their own talents by the sample of an "Ode on
4174: Shakspere's Birthday," or a translation from Horace.
4175: 
4176: Vorticella may pair off with Monas, who had also written his one
4177: book--'Here and There; or, a Trip from Truro to Transylvania'--and not
4178: only carried it in his portmanteau when he went on visits, but took the
4179: earliest opportunity of depositing it in the drawing-room, and
4180: afterwards would enter to look for it, as if under pressure of a need
4181: for reference, begging the lady of the house to tell him whether she,
4182: had seen "a small volume bound in red." One hostess at last ordered it
4183: to be carried into his bedroom to save his time; but it presently
4184: reappeared in his hands, and was again left with inserted slips of paper
4185: on the drawing-room table.
4186: 
4187: Depend upon it, vanity is human, native alike to men and women; only in
4188: the male it is of denser texture, less volatile, so that it less
4189: immediately informs you of its presence, but is more massive and capable
4190: of knocking you down if you come into collision with it; while in women
4191: vanity lays by its small revenges as in a needle-case always at hand.
4192: The difference is in muscle and finger-tips, in traditional habits and
4193: mental perspective, rather than in the original appetite of vanity. It
4194: is an approved method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the
4195: races as little like us as possible, which leads me to observe that in
4196: Fiji the men use the most elaborate hair-dressing, and that wherever
4197: tattooing is in vogue the male expects to carry off the prize of
4198: admiration for pattern and workmanship. Arguing analogically, and
4199: looking for this tendency of the Fijian or Hawaian male in the eminent
4200: European, we must suppose that it exhibits itself under the forms of
4201: civilised apparel; and it would be a great mistake to estimate
4202: passionate effort by the effect it produces on our perception or
4203: understanding. It is conceivable that a man may have concentrated no
4204: less will and expectation on his wristbands, gaiters, and the shape of
4205: his hat-brim, or an appearance which impresses you as that of the modern
4206: "swell," than the Ojibbeway on an ornamentation which seems to us much
4207: more elaborate. In what concerns the search for admiration at least, it
4208: is not true that the effect is equal to the cause and resembles it. The
4209: cause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead, such as might be seen
4210: when George the Fourth was king, must have been widely different in
4211: quality and intensity from the impression made by that small scroll of
4212: hair on the organ of the beholder. Merely to maintain an attitude and
4213: gait which I notice in certain club men, and especially an inflation of
4214: the chest accompanying very small remarks, there goes, I am convinced,
4215: an expenditure of psychical energy little appreciated by the
4216: multitude--a mental vision of Self and deeply impressed beholders which
4217: is quite without antitype in what we call the effect produced by that
4218: hidden process.
4219: 
4220: No! there is no need to admit that women would carry away the prize of
4221: vanity in a competition where differences of custom were fairly
4222: considered. A man cannot show his vanity in a tight skirt which forces
4223: him to walk sideways down the staircase; but let the match be between
4224: the respective vanities of largest beard and tightest skirt, and here
4225: too the battle would be to the strong.
4226: 
4227: 
4228: 
4229: 
4230: XVI.
4231: 
4232: 
4233: MORAL SWINDLERS.
4234: 
4235: It is a familiar example of irony in the degradation of words that "what
4236: a man is worth" has come to mean how much money he possesses; but there
4237: seems a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that
4238: popular or polite speech assigns to "morality" and "morals." The poor
4239: part these words are made to play recalls the fate of those pagan
4240: divinities who, after being understood to rule the powers of the air and
4241: the destinies of men, came down to the level of insignificant demons, or
4242: were even made a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude.
4243: 
4244: Talking to Melissa in a time of commercial trouble, I found her disposed
4245: to speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir Gavial
4246: Mantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to
4247: other companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of
4248: ignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled
4249: gentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his
4250: wife's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols.
4251: 
4252: "Surely your pity is misapplied," said I, rather dubiously, for I like
4253: the comfort of trusting that a correct moral judgment is the strong
4254: point in woman (seeing that she has a majority of about a million in our
4255: islands), and I imagined that Melissa might have some unexpressed
4256: grounds for her opinion. "I should have thought you would rather be
4257: sorry for Mantrap's victims--the widows, spinsters, and hard-working
4258: fathers whom his unscrupulous haste to make himself rich has cheated of
4259: all their savings, while he is eating well, lying softly, and after
4260: impudently justifying himself before the public, is perhaps joining in
4261: the General Confession with a sense that he is an acceptable object in
4262: the sight of God, though decent men refuse to meet him."
4263: 
4264: "Oh, all that about the Companies, I know, was most unfortunate. In
4265: commerce people are led to do so many things, and he might not know
4266: exactly how everything would turn out. But Sir Gavial made a good use of
4267: his money, and he is a thoroughly _moral_ man."
4268: 
4269: "What do you mean by a thoroughly moral man?" said I.
4270: 
4271: "Oh, I suppose every one means the same by that," said Melissa, with a
4272: slight air of rebuke. "Sir Gavial is an excellent family man--quite
4273: blameless there; and so charitable round his place at Tiptop. Very
4274: different from Mr Barabbas, whose life, my husband tells me, is most
4275: objectionable, with actresses and that sort of thing. I think a man's
4276: morals should make a difference to us. I'm not sorry for Mr Barabbas,
4277: but _I am_ sorry for Sir Gavial Mantrap."
4278: 
4279: I will not repeat my answer to Melissa, for I fear it was offensively
4280: brusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious
4281: scoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an effective
4282: part of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a
4283: man moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs. In fact, I had
4284: an angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen,
4285: noticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since
4286: heard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over
4287: strict in my views of morality.
4288: 
4289: I wish that this narrow use of words which are wanted in their full
4290: meaning were confined to women like Melissa. Seeing that Morality and
4291: Morals under their _alias_ of Ethics are the subject of voluminous
4292: discussion, and their true basis a pressing matter of dispute--seeing
4293: that the most famous book ever written on Ethics, and forming a chief
4294: study in our colleges, allies ethical with political science or that
4295: which treats of the constitution and prosperity of States, one might
4296: expect that educated men would find reason to avoid a perversion of
4297: language which lends itself to no wider view of life than that of
4298: village gossips. Yet I find even respectable historians of our own and
4299: of foreign countries, after showing that a king was treacherous,
4300: rapacious, and ready to sanction gross breaches in the administration of
4301: justice, end by praising him for his pure moral character, by which one
4302: must suppose them to mean that he was not lewd nor debauched, not the
4303: European twin of the typical Indian potentate whom Macaulay describes as
4304: passing his life in chewing bang and fondling dancing-girls. And since
4305: we are sometimes told of such maleficent kings that they were religious,
4306: we arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching
4307: duties of man lie quite outside both Morality and Religion--the one of
4308: these consisting in not keeping mistresses (and perhaps not drinking too
4309: much), and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transactions with
4310: God which can be carried on equally well side by side with the basest
4311: conduct towards men. With such a classification as this it is no wonder,
4312: considering the strong reaction of language on thought, that many minds,
4313: dizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy, are far to seek
4314: for the grounds of social duty, and without entertaining any private
4315: intention of committing a perjury which would ruin an innocent man, or
4316: seeking gain by supplying bad preserved meats to our navy, feel
4317: themselves speculatively obliged to inquire why they should not do so,
4318: and are inclined to measure their intellectual subtlety by their
4319: dissatisfaction with all answers to this "Why?" It is of little use to
4320: theorise in ethics while our habitual phraseology stamps the larger part
4321: of our social duties as something that lies aloof from the deepest needs
4322: and affections of our nature. The informal definitions of popular
4323: language are the only medium through which theory really affects the
4324: mass of minds even among the nominally educated; and when a man whose
4325: business hours, the solid part of every day, are spent in an
4326: unscrupulous course of public or private action which has every
4327: calculable chance of causing widespread injury and misery, can be called
4328: moral because he comes home to dine with his wife and children and
4329: cherishes the happiness of his own hearth, the augury is not good for
4330: the use of high ethical and theological disputation.
4331: 
4332: Not for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the
4333: relation of the sexes and the primary ties of kinship are the deepest
4334: roots of human wellbeing, but to make them by themselves the equivalent
4335: of morality is verbally to cut off the channels of feeling through
4336: which they are the feeders of that wellbeing. They are the original
4337: fountains of a sensibility to the claims of others, which is the bond of
4338: societies; but being necessarily in the first instance a private good,
4339: there is always the danger that individual selfishness will see in them
4340: only the best part of its own gain; just as knowledge, navigation,
4341: commerce, and all the conditions which are of a nature to awaken men's
4342: consciousness of their mutual dependence and to make the world one great
4343: society, are the occasions of selfish, unfair action, of war and
4344: oppression, so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling
4345: and opinion is not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what
4346: is demanded by the general welfare. And among the influences that must
4347: retard a right public judgment, the degradation of words which involve
4348: praise and blame will be reckoned worth protesting against by every
4349: mature observer. To rob words of half their meaning, while they retain
4350: their dignity as qualifications, is like allowing to men who have lost
4351: half their faculties the same high and perilous command which they won
4352: in their time of vigour; or like selling food and seeds after
4353: fraudulently abstracting their best virtues: in each case what ought to
4354: be beneficently strong is fatally enfeebled, if not empoisoned. Until we
4355: have altered our dictionaries and have found some other word than
4356: _morality_ to stand in popular use for the duties of man to man, let us
4357: refuse to accept as moral the contractor who enriches himself by using
4358: large machinery to make pasteboard soles pass as leather for the feet of
4359: unhappy conscripts fighting at miserable odds against invaders: let us
4360: rather call him a miscreant, though he were the tenderest, most faithful
4361: of husbands, and contend that his own experience of home happiness makes
4362: his reckless infliction of suffering on others all the more atrocious.
4363: Let us refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow
4364: his conduct in relation to great issues to be determined by egoistic
4365: passion, and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he
4366: were as lax in his personal habits as Sir Robert Walpole, if at the same
4367: time his sense of the public welfare were supreme in his mind, quelling
4368: all pettier impulses beneath a magnanimous impartiality. And though we
4369: were to find among that class of journalists who live by recklessly
4370: reporting injurious rumours, insinuating the blackest motives in
4371: opponents, descanting at large and with an air of infallibility on
4372: dreams which they both find and interpret, and stimulating bad feeling
4373: between nations by abusive writing which is as empty of real conviction
4374: as the rage of a pantomime king, and would be ludicrous if its effects
4375: did not make it appear diabolical--though we were to find among these a
4376: man who was benignancy itself in his own circle, a healer of private
4377: differences, a soother in private calamities, let us pronounce him
4378: nevertheless flagrantly immoral, a root of hideous cancer in the
4379: commonwealth, turning the channels of instruction into feeders of social
4380: and political disease.
4381: 
4382: In opposite ways one sees bad effects likely to be encouraged by this
4383: narrow use of the word _morals_, shutting out from its meaning half
4384: those actions of a man's life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of
4385: his fellow-citizens, and on the preparation of a future for the children
4386: growing up around him. Thoroughness of workmanship, care in the
4387: execution of every task undertaken, as if it were the acceptance of a
4388: trust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well, is a
4389: form of duty so momentous that if it were to die out from the feeling
4390: and practice of a people, all reforms of institutions would be helpless
4391: to create national prosperity and national happiness. Do we desire to
4392: see public spirit penetrating all classes of the community and affecting
4393: every man's conduct, so that he shall make neither the saving of his
4394: soul nor any other private saving an excuse for indifference to the
4395: general welfare? Well and good. But the sort of public spirit that
4396: scamps its bread-winning work, whether with the trowel, the pen, or the
4397: overseeing brain, that it may hurry to scenes of political or social
4398: agitation, would be as baleful a gift to our people as any malignant
4399: demon could devise. One best part of educational training is that which
4400: comes through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill, with
4401: its usual accompaniment of delight, in relation to work which is the
4402: daily bread-winning occupation--which is a man's contribution to the
4403: effective wealth of society in return for what he takes as his own
4404: share. But this duty of doing one's proper work well, and taking care
4405: that every product of one's labour shall be genuinely what it pretends
4406: to be, is not only left out of morals in popular speech, it is very
4407: little insisted on by public teachers, at least in the only effective
4408: way--by tracing the continuous effects of ill-done work. Some of them
4409: seem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence
4410: from week-day services, ecclesiastical decoration, and improved
4411: hymn-books; others apparently trust to descanting on self-culture in
4412: general, or to raising a general sense of faulty circumstances; and
4413: meanwhile lax, make-shift work, from the high conspicuous kind to the
4414: average and obscure, is allowed to pass unstamped with the disgrace of
4415: immorality, though there is not a member of society who is not daily
4416: suffering from it materially and spiritually, and though it is the fatal
4417: cause that must degrade our national rank and our commerce in spite of
4418: all open markets and discovery of available coal-seams.
4419: 
4420: I suppose one may take the popular misuse of the words Morality and
4421: Morals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are occasional
4422: fashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the
4423: queerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into
4424: loftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether
4425: they have a human face or not is of little consequence. One is, the
4426: notion that there is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between
4427: intellect and morality. I do not mean the simple statement of fact,
4428: which everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty
4429: morals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard;
4430: but the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will
4431: see through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a
4432: doctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity. We begin to
4433: understand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we
4434: live in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a
4435: malignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or
4436: literary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or
4437: a manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who
4438: deals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of
4439: his excellent morals.
4440: 
4441: Clearly if morality meant no more than such decencies as are practised
4442: by these poisonous members of society, it would be possible to say,
4443: without suspicion of light-headedness, that morality lay aloof from the
4444: grand stream of human affairs, as a small channel fed by the stream and
4445: not missed from it. While this form of nonsense is conveyed in the
4446: popular use of words, there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at
4447: leisure to run through a box of books, which will feel itself initiated
4448: in the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a
4449: Shaksperian motto--
4450: 
4451:   "Fair is foul and foul is fair,
4452:   Hover through the fog and filthy air"--
4453: 
4454: and will find itself easily provided with striking conversation by the
4455: rule of reversing all the judgments on good and evil which have come to
4456: be the calendar and clock-work of society. But let our habitual talk
4457: give morals their full meaning as the conduct which, in every human
4458: relation, would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest
4459: sympathy--a meaning perpetually corrected and enriched by a more
4460: thorough appreciation of dependence in things, and a finer sensibility
4461: to both physical and spiritual fact--and this ridiculous ascription of
4462: superlative power to minds which have no effective awe-inspiring vision
4463: of the human lot, no response of understanding to the connection between
4464: duty and the material processes by which the world is kept habitable for
4465: cultivated man, will be tacitly discredited without any need to cite the
4466: immortal names that all are obliged to take as the measure of
4467: intellectual rank and highly-charged genius.
4468: 
4469: Suppose a Frenchman--I mean no disrespect to the great French nation,
4470: for all nations are afflicted with their peculiar parasitic growths,
4471: which are lazy, hungry forms, usually characterised by a
4472: disproportionate swallowing apparatus: suppose a Parisian who should
4473: shuffle down the Boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest cares and
4474: the deepest tenderness of manhood, and a frame more or less fevered by
4475: debauchery, mentally polishing into utmost refinement of phrase and
4476: rhythm verses which were an enlargement on that Shaksperian motto, and
4477: worthy of the most expensive title to be furnished by the vendors of
4478: such antithetic ware as _Les_ _marguerites de l'Enfer_, or _Les délices
4479: de Béelzébuth_. This supposed personage might probably enough regard his
4480: negation of those moral sensibilities which make half the warp and woof
4481: of human history, his indifference to the hard thinking and hard
4482: handiwork of life, to which he owed even his own gauzy mental garments
4483: with their spangles of poor paradox, as the royalty of genius, for we
4484: are used to witness such self-crowning in many forms of mental
4485: alienation; but he would not, I think, be taken, even by his own
4486: generation, as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as
4487: that of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with
4488: the large yet finely discriminating vision which marks the intellectual
4489: masters of our kind. Doubtless there are many sorts of transfiguration,
4490: and a man who has come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may
4491: have had his swinish period, wallowing in ugly places; but suppose it
4492: had been handed down to us that Sophocles or Virgil had at one time made
4493: himself scandalous in this way: the works which have consecrated their
4494: memory for our admiration and gratitude are not a glorifying of
4495: swinishness, but an artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment
4496: known to their age.
4497: 
4498: All these may seem to be wide reasons for objecting to Melissa's pity
4499: for Sir Gavial Mantrap on the ground of his good morals; but their
4500: connection will not be obscure to any one who has taken pains to observe
4501: the links uniting the scattered signs of our social development.

4508: 
4509: SHADOWS OF THE COMING RACE.
4510: 
4511: My friend Trost, who is no optimist as to the state of the universe
4512: hitherto, but is confident that at some future period within the
4513: duration of the solar system, ours will be the best of all possible
4514: worlds--a hope which I always honour as a sign of beneficent
4515: qualities--my friend Trost always tries to keep up my spirits under the
4516: sight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of
4517: our fellow-creatures have to get their bread, with the assurance that
4518: "all this will soon be done by machinery." But he sometimes neutralises
4519: the consolation by extending it over so large an area of human labour,
4520: and insisting so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus
4521: be set free for loftier purposes, that I am tempted to desire an
4522: occasional famine of invention in the coming ages, lest the humbler
4523: kinds of work should be entirely nullified while there are still left
4524: some men and women who are not fit for the highest.
4525: 
4526: Especially, when one considers the perfunctory way in which some of the
4527: most exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to
4528: be educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race
4529: evolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of
4530: work. When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine
4531: for testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus
4532: that, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in
4533: turn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and
4534: dismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of
4535: micrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with
4536: the invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires
4537: and wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my
4538: quickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing
4539: the right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into
4540: an automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects
4541: the cadence of the fly's foot on the ceiling, and may be expected
4542: presently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they
4543: soliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for
4544: these things, I get a little out of it, like an unfortunate savage too
4545: suddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim--
4546: 
4547: "Am I already in the shadow of the Coming Race? and will the creatures
4548: who are to transcend and finally supersede us be steely organisms,
4549: giving out the effluvia of the laboratory, and performing with
4550: infallible exactness more than everything that we have performed with a
4551: slovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy?"
4552: 
4553: "But," says Trost, treating me with cautious mildness on hearing me vent
4554: this raving notion, "you forget that these wonder-workers are the slaves
4555: of our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our
4556: consciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we
4557: decipher and make use of. They are simply extensions of the human
4558: organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more
4559: subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the
4560: invisibly small. Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill
4561: to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often
4562: keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances. How
4563: then can machines supersede us?--they depend upon us. When we cease,
4564: they cease."
4565: 
4566: "I am not so sure of that," said I, getting back into my mind, and
4567: becoming rather wilful in consequence. "If, as I have heard you contend,
4568: machines as they are more and more perfected will require less and less
4569: of tendance, how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to
4570: carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply,
4571: self-repair, and reproduction, and not only do all the mighty and subtle
4572: work possible on this planet better than we could do it, but with the
4573: immense advantage of banishing from the earth's atmosphere screaming
4574: consciousnesses which, in our comparatively clumsy race, make an
4575: intolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like
4576: performance, looking on at all work only as it were to spring a rattle
4577: here or blow a trumpet there, with a ridiculous sense of being
4578: effective? I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently
4579: penetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so,
4580: should not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were
4581: excellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable
4582: instrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a
4583: powerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable
4584: instrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the
4585: ancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick
4586: iron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge
4587: operating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by
4588: necessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we
4589: call the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as
4590: "sensitive." For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to
4591: say, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not
4592: the less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that
4593: consciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank,
4594: when in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things."
4595: 
4596: "Nothing of the sort!" returned Trost, getting angry, and judging it
4597: kind to treat me with some severity; "what you have heard me say is,
4598: that our race will and must act as a nervous centre to the utmost
4599: development of mechanical processes: the subtly refined powers of
4600: machines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes
4601: which will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour. Say, for
4602: example, that all the scavengers' work of London were done, so far as
4603: human attention is concerned, by the occasional pressure of a brass
4604: button (as in the ringing of an electric bell), you will then have a
4605: multitude of brains set free for the exquisite enjoyment of dealing with
4606: the exact sequences and high speculations supplied and prompted by the
4607: delicate machines which yield a response to the fixed stars, and give
4608: readings of the spiral vortices fundamentally concerned in the
4609: production of epic poems or great judicial harangues. So far from
4610: mankind being thrown out of work according to your notion," concluded
4611: Trost, with a peculiar nasal note of scorn, "if it were not for your
4612: incurable dilettanteism in science as in all other things--if you had
4613: once understood the action of any delicate machine--you would perceive
4614: that the sequences it carries throughout the realm of phenomena would
4615: require many generations, perhaps aeons, of understandings considerably
4616: stronger than yours, to exhaust the store of work it lays open."
4617: 
4618: "Precisely," said I, with a meekness which I felt was praiseworthy; "it
4619: is the feebleness of my capacity, bringing me nearer than you to the
4620: human average, that perhaps enables me to imagine certain results better
4621: than you can. Doubtless the very fishes of our rivers, gullible as they
4622: look, and slow as they are to be rightly convinced in another order of
4623: facts, form fewer false expectations about each other than we should
4624: form about them if we were in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse
4625: with their species; for even as it is we have continually to be
4626: surprised that they do not rise to our carefully selected bait. Take me
4627: then as a sort of reflective and experienced carp; but do not estimate
4628: the justice of my ideas by my facial expression."
4629: 
4630: "Pooh!" says Trost. (We are on very intimate terms.)
4631: 
4632: "Naturally," I persisted, "it is less easy to you than to me to imagine
4633: our race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is
4634: possessed of, the harder it must be for him to conceive his own death.
4635: But I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine
4636: myself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving
4637: way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity. What I
4638: would ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new
4639: light along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or
4640: structure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw,
4641: there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and
4642: chemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply
4643: its own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular
4644: movements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding. This
4645: last stage having been reached, either by man's contrivance or as an
4646: unforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must
4647: drive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have
4648: begun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters
4649: in fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged
4650: to supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short
4651: a time. What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less
4652: tremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness
4653: screeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of
4654: a swift horseman? Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will
4655: have diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the
4656: time that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a
4657: few of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become
4658: pale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold
4659: around them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring. As to the breed of the
4660: ingenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been
4661: overwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely
4662: more powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less
4663: energetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle
4664: in the sunlight. Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments
4665: happened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined
4666: itself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted
4667: existences do before the fittest--_i.e._, the existence composed of the
4668: most persistent groups of movements and the most capable of
4669: incorporating new groups in harmonious relation. Who--if our
4670: consciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling
4671: of our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say
4672: that those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what
4673: we call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate
4674: processes as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals
4675: are metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the
4676: earth's crust? Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be
4677: blind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate
4678: and complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of
4679: what we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without
4680: sensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute
4681: rhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy
4682: the silence."
4683: 
4684: "Absurd!" grumbled Trost.
4685: 
4686: "The supposition is logical," said I. "It is well argued from the
4687: premises."
4688: 
4689: "Whose premises?" cried Trost, turning on me with some fierceness. "You
4690: don't mean to call them mine, I hope."
4691: 
4692: "Heaven forbid! They seem to be flying about in the air with other
4693: germs, and have found a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancies.
4694: Nobody really holds them. They bear the same relation to real belief as
4695: walking on the head for a show does to running away from an explosion or
4696: walking fast to catch the train."
4697:

4699:

4701: XVIII.
4702: 
4703: 
4704: THE MODERN HEP! HEP! HEP!
4705: 
4706: To discern likeness amidst diversity, it is well known, does not require
4707: so fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general
4708: sameness. The primary rough classification depends on the prominent
4709: resemblances of things: the progress is towards finer and finer
4710: discrimination according to minute differences. Yet even at this stage
4711: of European culture one's attention is continually drawn to the
4712: prevalence of that grosser mental sloth which makes people dull to the
4713: most ordinary prompting of comparison--the bringing things together
4714: because of their likeness. The same motives, the same ideas, the same
4715: practices, are alternately admired and abhorred, lauded and denounced,
4716: according to their association with superficial differences, historical
4717: or actually social: even learned writers treating of great subjects
4718: often show an attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that
4719: of the frivolous fine lady who is indignant at the frivolity of her
4720: maid.
4721: 
4722: To take only the subject of the Jews: it would be difficult to find a
4723: form of bad reasoning about them which has not been heard in
4724: conversation or been admitted to the dignity of print; but the neglect
4725: of resemblances is a common property of dulness which unites all the
4726: various points of view--the prejudiced, the puerile, the spiteful, and
4727: the abysmally ignorant.
4728: 
4729: That the preservation of national memories is an element and a means of
4730: national greatness, that their revival is a sign of reviving
4731: nationality, that every heroic defender, every patriotic restorer, has
4732: been inspired by such memories and has made them his watchword, that
4733: even such a corporate existence as that of a Roman legion or an English
4734: regiment has been made valorous by memorial standards,--these are the
4735: glorious commonplaces of historic teaching at our public schools and
4736: universities, being happily ingrained in Greek and Latin classics. They
4737: have also been impressed on the world by conspicuous modern instances.
4738: That there is a free modern Greece is due--through all infiltration of
4739: other than Greek blood--to the presence of ancient Greece in the
4740: consciousness of European men; and every speaker would feel his point
4741: safe if he were to praise Byron's devotion to a cause made glorious by
4742: ideal identification with the past; hardly so, if he were to insist that
4743: the Greeks were not to be helped further because their history shows
4744: that they were anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lying, and that
4745: many modern Greeks are highly disreputable characters, while others are
4746: disposed to grasp too large a share of our commerce. The same with
4747: Italy: the pathos of his country's lot pierced the youthful soul of
4748: Mazzini, because, like Dante's, his blood was fraught with the kinship
4749: of Italian greatness, his imagination filled with a majestic past that
4750: wrought itself into a majestic future. Half a century ago, what was
4751: Italy? An idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless
4752: wealth, a territory parcelled out for papal sustenance, dynastic
4753: convenience, and the profit of an alien Government. What were the
4754: Italians? No people, no voice in European counsels, no massive power in
4755: European affairs: a race thought of in English and French society as
4756: chiefly adapted to the operatic stage, or to serve as models for
4757: painters; disposed to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpence;
4758: and by the more historical remembered to be rather polite than truthful,
4759: in all probability a combination of Machiavelli, Rubini, and Masaniello.
4760: Thanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspires the moments
4761: with a past, a present, and a future, and gives the sense of corporate
4762: existence that raises man above the otherwise more respectable and
4763: innocent brute, all that, or most of it, is changed.
4764: 
4765: Again, one of our living historians finds just sympathy in his vigorous
4766: insistance on our true ancestry, on our being the strongly marked
4767: heritors in language and genius of those old English seamen who,
4768: beholding a rich country with a most convenient seaboard, came,
4769: doubtless with a sense of divine warrant, and settled themselves on this
4770: or the other side of fertilising streams, gradually conquering more and
4771: more of the pleasant land from the natives who knew nothing of Odin,
4772: and finally making unusually clean work in ridding themselves of those
4773: prior occupants. "Let us," he virtually says, "let us know who were our
4774: forefathers, who it was that won the soil for us, and brought the good
4775: seed of those institutions through which we should not arrogantly but
4776: gratefully feel ourselves distinguished among the nations as possessors
4777: of long-inherited freedom; let us not keep up an ignorant kind of naming
4778: which disguises our true affinities of blood and language, but let us
4779: see thoroughly what sort of notions and traditions our forefathers had,
4780: and what sort of song inspired them. Let the poetic fragments which
4781: breathe forth their fierce bravery in battle and their trust in fierce
4782: gods who helped them, be treasured with affectionate reverence. These
4783: seafaring, invading, self-asserting men were the English of old time,
4784: and were our fathers who did rough work by which we are profiting. They
4785: had virtues which incorporated themselves in wholesome usages to which
4786: we trace our own political blessings. Let us know and acknowledge our
4787: common relationship to them, and be thankful that over and above the
4788: affections and duties which spring from our manhood, we have the closer
4789: and more constantly guiding duties which belong to us as Englishmen."
4790: 
4791: To this view of our nationality most persons who have feeling and
4792: understanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the
4793: patriotic affection and every other affection which lifts us above
4794: emigrating rats and free-loving baboons, will be disposed to say Amen.
4795: True, we are not indebted to those ancestors for our religion: we are
4796: rather proud of having got that illumination from elsewhere. The men who
4797: planted our nation were not Christians, though they began their work
4798: centuries after Christ; and they had a decided objection to Christianity
4799: when it was first proposed to them: they were not monotheists, and their
4800: religion was the reverse of spiritual. But since we have been fortunate
4801: enough to keep the island-home they won for us, and have been on the
4802: whole a prosperous people, rather continuing the plan of invading and
4803: spoiling other lands than being forced to beg for shelter in them,
4804: nobody has reproached us because our fathers thirteen hundred years ago
4805: worshipped Odin, massacred Britons, and were with difficulty persuaded
4806: to accept Christianity, knowing nothing of Hebrew history and the
4807: reasons why Christ should be received as the Saviour of mankind. The Red
4808: Indians, not liking us when we settled among them, might have been
4809: willing to fling such facts in our faces, but they were too ignorant,
4810: and besides, their opinions did not signify, because we were able, if we
4811: liked, to exterminate them. The Hindoos also have doubtless had their
4812: rancours against us and still entertain enough ill-will to make
4813: unfavourable remarks on our character, especially as to our historic
4814: rapacity and arrogant notions of our own superiority; they perhaps do
4815: not admire the usual English profile, and they are not converted to our
4816: way of feeding: but though we are a small number of an alien race
4817: profiting by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people, they
4818: are unable to turn us out; at least, when they tried we showed them
4819: their mistake. We do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punished
4820: people: we are a colonising people, and it is we who have punished
4821: others.
4822: 
4823: Still the historian guides us rightly in urging us to dwell on the
4824: virtues of our ancestors with emulation, and to cherish our sense of a
4825: common descent as a bond of obligation. The eminence, the nobleness of a
4826: people depends on its capability of being stirred by memories, and of
4827: striving for what we call spiritual ends--ends which consist not in
4828: immediate material possession, but in the satisfaction of a great
4829: feeling that animates the collective body as with one soul. A people
4830: having the seed of worthiness in it must feel an answering thrill when
4831: it is adjured by the deaths of its heroes who died to preserve its
4832: national existence; when it is reminded of its small beginnings and
4833: gradual growth through past labours and struggles, such as are still
4834: demanded of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherited
4835: may be transmitted unimpaired to children and children's children; when
4836: an appeal against the permission of injustice is made to great
4837: precedents in its history and to the better genius breathing in its
4838: institutions. It is this living force of sentiment in common which makes
4839: a national consciousness. Nations so moved will resist conquest with
4840: the very breasts of their women, will pay their millions and their blood
4841: to abolish slavery, will share privation in famine and all calamity,
4842: will produce poets to sing "some great story of a man," and thinkers
4843: whose theories will bear the test of action. An individual man, to be
4844: harmoniously great, must belong to a nation of this order, if not in
4845: actual existence yet existing in the past, in memory, as a departed,
4846: invisible, beloved ideal, once a reality, and perhaps to be restored. A
4847: common humanity is not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various
4848: activity which makes a complete man. The time is not come for
4849: cosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous, any more than for communism to
4850: suffice for social energy. I am not bound to feel for a Chinaman as I
4851: feel for my fellow-countryman: I am bound not to demoralise him with
4852: opium, not to compel him to my will by destroying or plundering the
4853: fruits of his labour on the alleged ground that he is not cosmopolitan
4854: enough, and not to insult him for his want of my tailoring and religion
4855: when he appears as a peaceable visitor on the London pavement. It is
4856: admirable in a Briton with a good purpose to learn Chinese, but it
4857: would not be a proof of fine intellect in him to taste Chinese poetry in
4858: the original more than he tastes the poetry of his own tongue.
4859: Affection, intelligence, duty, radiate from a centre, and nature has
4860: decided that for us English folk that centre can be neither China nor
4861: Peru. Most of us feel this unreflectingly; for the affectation of
4862: undervaluing everything native, and being too fine for one's own
4863: country, belongs only to a few minds of no dangerous leverage. What is
4864: wanting is, that we should recognise a corresponding attachment to
4865: nationality as legitimate in every other people, and understand that its
4866: absence is a privation of the greatest good.
4867: 
4868: For, to repeat, not only the nobleness of a nation depends on the
4869: presence of this national consciousness, but also the nobleness of each
4870: individual citizen. Our dignity and rectitude are proportioned to our
4871: sense of relationship with something great, admirable, pregnant with
4872: high possibilities, worthy of sacrifice, a continual inspiration to
4873: self-repression and discipline by the presentation of aims larger and
4874: more attractive to our generous part than the securing of personal ease
4875: or prosperity. And a people possessing this good should surely feel not
4876: only a ready sympathy with the effort of those who, having lost the
4877: good, strive to regain it, but a profound pity for any degradation
4878: resulting from its loss; nay, something more than pity when happier
4879: nationalities have made victims of the unfortunate whose memories
4880: nevertheless are the very fountain to which the persecutors trace their
4881: most vaunted blessings.
4882: 
4883: These notions are familiar: few will deny them in the abstract, and many
4884: are found loudly asserting them in relation to this or the other
4885: particular case. But here as elsewhere, in the ardent application of
4886: ideas, there is a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to
4887: resemblance. The European world has long been used to consider the Jews
4888: as altogether exceptional, and it has followed naturally enough that
4889: they have been excepted from the rules of justice and mercy, which are
4890: based on human likeness. But to consider a people whose ideas have
4891: determined the religion of half the world, and that the more cultivated
4892: half, and who made the most eminent struggle against the power of Rome,
4893: as a purely exceptional race, is a demoralising offence against rational
4894: knowledge, a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation.
4895: Every nation of forcible character--_i.e._, of strongly marked
4896: characteristics, is so far exceptional. The distinctive note of each
4897: bird-species is in this sense exceptional, but the necessary ground of
4898: such distinction is a deeper likeness. The superlative peculiarity in
4899: the Jews admitted, our affinity with them is only the more apparent when
4900: the elements of their peculiarity are discerned.
4901: 
4902: From whatever point of view the writings of the Old Testament may be
4903: regarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high
4904: interest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much
4905: affected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the
4906: New Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity. Whether
4907: we accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part
4908: of an ancient literature, makes no difference to the fact that we find
4909: there the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from
4910: an earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its
4911: intensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify
4912: faithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and
4913: religious blessings. Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the
4914: return under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against
4915: Rome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which
4916: rescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting
4917: sway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials,
4918: and stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain
4919: and develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for,
4920: by internal measures of legal administration and public teaching.
4921: Thenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as
4922: they had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful
4923: prophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of
4924: preserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion
4925: with that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and
4926: often obscene. There was always a Foreign party reviling the National
4927: party as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in
4928: extensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a
4929: foreign power. Such internal conflict naturally tightened the bands of
4930: conservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred
4931: ark, the vital spirit of a small nation--"the smallest of the
4932: nations"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents;
4933: and when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into
4934: dread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose
4935: chief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the
4936: submergence of their nationality. Much might be said on this point
4937: towards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which
4938: is regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless
4939: insurrection against an established native government; and for my part
4940: (if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots. I
4941: take the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and
4942: preferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of
4943: Caligula's deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of
4944: steadfastness. But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of
4945: that national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which
4946: created in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence,
4947: unique in its intensity.
4948: 
4949: But not, before the dispersion, unique in essential qualities. There is
4950: more likeness than contrast between the way we English got our island
4951: and the way the Israelites got Canaan. We have not been noted for
4952: forming a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigners, or
4953: for admitting that our institutions are equalled by those of any other
4954: people under the sun. Many of us have thought that our sea-wall is a
4955: specially divine arrangement to make and keep us a nation of sea-kings
4956: after the manner of our forefathers, secure against invasion and able to
4957: invade other lands when we need them, though they may lie on the other
4958: side of the ocean. Again, it has been held that we have a peculiar
4959: destiny as a Protestant people, not only able to bruise the head of an
4960: idolatrous Christianity in the midst of us, but fitted as possessors of
4961: the most truth and the most tonnage to carry our purer religion over the
4962: world and convert mankind to our way of thinking. The Puritans,
4963: asserting their liberty to restrain tyrants, found the Hebrew history
4964: closely symbolical of their feelings and purpose; and it can hardly be
4965: correct to cast the blame of their less laudable doings on the writings
4966: they invoked, since their opponents made use of the same writings for
4967: different ends, finding there a strong warrant for the divine right of
4968: kings and the denunciation of those who, like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
4969: took on themselves the office of the priesthood which belonged of right
4970: solely to Aaron and his sons, or, in other words, to men ordained by the
4971: English bishops. We must rather refer the passionate use of the Hebrew
4972: writings to affinities of disposition between our own race and the
4973: Jewish. Is it true that the arrogance of a Jew was so immeasurably
4974: beyond that of a Calvinist? And the just sympathy and admiration which
4975: we give to the ancestors who resisted the oppressive acts of our native
4976: kings, and by resisting rescued or won for us the best part of our civil
4977: and religious liberties--is it justly to be withheld from those brave
4978: and steadfast men of Jewish race who fought and died, or strove by wise
4979: administration to resist, the oppression and corrupting influences of
4980: foreign tyrants, and by resisting rescued the nationality which was the
4981: very hearth of our own religion? At any rate, seeing that the Jews were
4982: more specifically than any other nation educated into a sense of their
4983: supreme moral value, the chief matter of surprise is that any other
4984: nation is found to rival them in this form of self-confidence.
4985: 
4986: More exceptional--less like the course of our own history--has been
4987: their dispersion and their subsistence as a separate people through ages
4988: in which for the most part they were regarded and treated very much as
4989: beasts hunted for the sake of their skins, or of a valuable secretion
4990: peculiar to their species. The Jews showed a talent for accumulating
4991: what was an object of more immediate desire to Christians than animal
4992: oils or well-furred skins, and their cupidity and avarice were found at
4993: once particularly hateful and particularly useful: hateful when seen as
4994: a reason for punishing them by mulcting or robbery, useful when this
4995: retributive process could be successfully carried forward. Kings and
4996: emperors naturally were more alive to the usefulness of subjects who
4997: could gather and yield money; but edicts issued to protect "the King's
4998: Jews" equally with the King's game from being harassed and hunted by the
4999: commonalty were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race
5000: held to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the
5001: Crusades began. As the slave-holders in the United States counted the
5002: curse on Ham a justification of negro slavery, so the curse on the Jews
5003: was counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture
5004: and handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable figures by a peculiar
5005: dress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for
5006: more gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as
5007: certain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took
5008: pains to spread the plague; for putting it to them whether they would be
5009: baptised or burned, and not failing to burn and massacre them when they
5010: were obstinate; but also for suspecting them of disliking the baptism
5011: when they had got it, and then burning them in punishment of their
5012: insincerity; finally, for hounding them by tens on tens of thousands
5013: from the homes where they had found shelter for centuries, and
5014: inflicting on them the horrors of a new exile and a new dispersion. All
5015: this to avenge the Saviour of mankind, or else to compel these
5016: stiff-necked people to acknowledge a Master whose servants showed such
5017: beneficent effects of His teaching.
5018: 
5019: With a people so treated one of two issues was possible: either from
5020: being of feebler nature than their persecutors, and caring more for ease
5021: than for the sentiments and ideas which constituted their distinctive
5022: character, they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly
5023: merged in the populations around them; or, being endowed with uncommon
5024: tenacity, physical and mental, feeling peculiarly the ties of
5025: inheritance both in blood and faith, remembering national glories,
5026: trusting in their recovery, abhorring apostasy, able to bear all things
5027: and hope all things with the consciousness of being steadfast to
5028: spiritual obligations, the kernel of their number would harden into an
5029: inflexibility more and more insured by motive and habit. They would
5030: cherish all differences that marked them off from their hated
5031: oppressors, all memories that consoled them with a sense of virtual
5032: though unrecognised superiority; and the separateness which was made
5033: their badge of ignominy would be their inward pride, their source of
5034: fortifying defiance. Doubtless such a people would get confirmed in
5035: vices. An oppressive government and a persecuting religion, while
5036: breeding vices in those who hold power, are well known to breed
5037: answering vices in those who are powerless and suffering. What more
5038: direct plan than the course presented by European history could have
5039: been pursued in order to give the Jews a spirit of bitter isolation, of
5040: scorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that made victims of them, of triumph in
5041: prospering at the expense of the blunderers who stoned them away from
5042: the open paths of industry?--or, on the other hand, to encourage in the
5043: less defiant a lying conformity, a pretence of conversion for the sake
5044: of the social advantages attached to baptism, an outward renunciation of
5045: their hereditary ties with the lack of real love towards the society
5046: and creed which exacted this galling tribute?--or again, in the most
5047: unhappy specimens of the race, to rear transcendent examples of odious
5048: vice, reckless instruments of rich men with bad propensities,
5049: unscrupulous grinders of the alien people who wanted to grind _them_?
5050: 
5051: No wonder the Jews have their vices: no wonder if it were proved (which
5052: it has not hitherto appeared to be) that some of them have a bad
5053: pre-eminence in evil, an unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness. It would
5054: be more plausible to make a wonder of the virtues which have prospered
5055: among them under the shadow of oppression. But instead of dwelling on
5056: these, or treating as admitted what any hardy or ignorant person may
5057: deny, let us found simply on the loud assertions of the hostile. The
5058: Jews, it is said, resisted the expansion of their own religion into
5059: Christianity; they were in the habit of spitting on the cross; they have
5060: held the name of Christ to be _Anathema_. Who taught them that? The men
5061: who made Christianity a curse to them: the men who made the name of
5062: Christ a symbol for the spirit of vengeance, and, what was worse, made
5063: the execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfying their own
5064: savageness, greed, and envy: the men who sanctioned with the name of
5065: Christ a barbaric and blundering copy of pagan fatalism in taking the
5066: words "His blood be upon us and on our children" as a divinely appointed
5067: verbal warrant for wreaking cruelty from generation to generation on the
5068: people from whose sacred writings Christ drew His teaching. Strange
5069: retrogression in the professors of an expanded religion, boasting an
5070: illumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of Hebrew prophets! For
5071: Hebrew prophets proclaimed a God who demanded mercy rather than
5072: sacrifices. The Christians also believed that God delighted not in the
5073: blood of rams and of bulls, but they apparently conceived Him as
5074: requiring for His satisfaction the sighs and groans, the blood and
5075: roasted flesh of men whose forefathers had misunderstood the
5076: metaphorical character of prophecies which spoke of spiritual
5077: pre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom. Was this the method
5078: by which Christ desired His title to the Messiahship to be commended to
5079: the hearts and understandings of the nation in which He was born? Many
5080: of His sayings bear the stamp of that patriotism which places
5081: fellow-countrymen in the inner circle of affection and duty. And did the
5082: words "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do," refer only to
5083: the centurion and his band, a tacit exception being made of every Hebrew
5084: there present from the mercy of the Father and the compassion of the
5085: Son?--nay, more, of every Hebrew yet to come who remained unconverted
5086: after hearing of His claim to the Messiahship, not from His own lips or
5087: those of His native apostles, but from the lips of alien men whom cross,
5088: creed, and baptism had left cruel, rapacious, and debauched? It is more
5089: reverent to Christ to believe that He must have approved the Jewish
5090: martyrs who deliberately chose to be burned or massacred rather than be
5091: guilty of a blaspheming lie, more than He approved the rabble of
5092: crusaders who robbed and murdered them in His name. But these
5093: remonstrances seem to have no direct application to personages who take
5094: up the attitude of philosophic thinkers and discriminating critics,
5095: professedly accepting Christianity from a rational point of view as a
5096: vehicle of the highest religious and moral truth, and condemning the
5097: Jews on the ground that they are obstinate adherents of an outworn
5098: creed, maintain themselves in moral alienation from the peoples with
5099: whom they share citizenship, and are destitute of real interest in the
5100: welfare of the community and state with which they are thus identified.
5101: These anti-Judaic advocates usually belong to a party which has felt
5102: itself glorified in winning for Jews, as well as Dissenters and
5103: Catholics, the full privileges of citizenship, laying open to them every
5104: path to distinction. At one time the voice of this party urged that
5105: differences of creed were made dangerous only by the denial of
5106: citizenship--that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel
5107: like one. At present, apparently, this confidence has been succeeded by
5108: a sense of mistake: there is a regret that no limiting clauses were
5109: insisted on, such as would have hindered the Jews from coming too far
5110: and in too large proportion along those opened pathways; and the
5111: Roumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them
5112: as little chance as possible. But then, the reflection occurring that
5113: some of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is
5114: obvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine
5115: that you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted.
5116: But clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by
5117: disagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who
5118: argued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness
5119: minds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready
5120: to force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly
5121: recurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are
5122: made viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world's money-bag, that for
5123: them all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that
5124: they have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally
5125: inferior, and--"serve them right," since they rejected Christianity. All
5126: which is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a
5127: servile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been
5128: repeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose
5129: place in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the
5130: clause, "No Irish need apply," parallels the sentence which for many
5131: polite persons sums up the question of Judaism--"I never _did_ like the
5132: Jews."
5133: 
5134: It is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised
5135: race, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not
5136: inevitably lack some conditions of nobleness. If they drop that
5137: separateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of
5138: lapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of
5139: missing that inward identification with the nationality immediately
5140: around them which might make some amends for their inherited privation.
5141: No dispassionate observer can deny this danger. Why, our own countrymen
5142: who take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their
5143: sense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good
5144: specimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a
5145: native country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,
5146: existing like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of
5147: being included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations
5148: and the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging
5149: which is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these
5150: spiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst
5151: consequences of their voluntary dispersion. Unquestionably the Jews,
5152: having been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral
5153: influences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have
5154: suffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have
5155: escaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the
5156: nations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in
5157: the case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate
5158: religion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family
5159: affectionateness. Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on
5160: which rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name
5161: flung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,
5162: they have remained proud of their origin. Does any one call this an evil
5163: pride? Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a
5164: democratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his
5165: father was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,
5166: or who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman. It
5167: is possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that
5168: arrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence. The pride which
5169: identifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating
5170: habit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or
5171: other selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man
5172: swayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject. That a Jew of
5173: Smyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too
5174: officious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, "I am a
5175: Jew," is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of
5176: understanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history. And
5177: again, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different
5178: countries tends to the impression that they have a predominant
5179: kindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of
5180: their race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression.
5181: The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the
5182: capacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the
5183: care for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their
5184: religion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by
5185: exclusiveness. And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of
5186: division between him and the Gentile. On the whole, one of the most
5187: remarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for
5188: ages "a scorn and a hissing" is, that after being subjected to this
5189: process, which might have been expected to be in every sense
5190: deteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate
5191: which allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all
5192: European countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical
5193: ability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of
5194: ethical value. A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in
5195: the fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany
5196: is a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the
5197: head of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew. And here it is
5198: that we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now
5199: stimulating the revived expression of old antipathies. "The Jews," it is
5200: felt, "have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in
5201: commerce but in political life. Their monetary hold on governments is
5202: tending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism
5203: (euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given
5204: them a full share in civil and political rights. A people with oriental
5205: sunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,
5206: they have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best
5207: prizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament
5208: at their disposal."
5209: 
5210: There is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations.
5211: But it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely
5212: vituperative sense. Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger
5213: of our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish
5214: predominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws? Not all the
5215: Germanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,
5216: and are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic
5217: and more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and
5218: erudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are
5219: dangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,
5220: and wealth. Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician
5221: blood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city. Some judges
5222: think that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South
5223: than is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early
5224: inconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a
5225: hungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of
5226: religion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not
5227: yet been quite neutralised. As for the Irish, it is felt in high
5228: quarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,
5229: if they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many
5230: of them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the
5231: Scotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour.
5232: 
5233: So far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder
5234: people of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of
5235: dwelling among us.
5236: 
5237: Let it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other
5238: great historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of
5239: alien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in
5240: danger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers.
5241: I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the
5242: threatened danger. To one who loves his native language, who would
5243: delight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign
5244: accent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal
5245: meaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an
5246: affliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our
5247: studios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,
5248: warehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English
5249: with its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of
5250: acquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,
5251: delivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred
5252: beyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak
5253: every language except our mother English, which persons "of style" are
5254: not ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a
5255: pronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them
5256: between jostling consonants. An ancient Greek might not like to be
5257: resuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,
5258: still he would at least find more instructive marvels in other
5259: developments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern
5260: Englishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere
5261: delivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some
5262: novelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on
5263: prepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom. Well! it is
5264: our inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our
5265: willing ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,
5266: while we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile
5267: imitation of what is native.
5268: 
5269: This marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what
5270: must follow from the predominance of wealth-acquiring immigrants, whose
5271: appreciation of our political and social life must often be as
5272: approximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language.
5273: But take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them? Are we to
5274: adopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese? Are we
5275: to tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the
5276: world-wide blessing of the oppressed? It is not agreeable to find
5277: foreign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant
5278: exception to the general rule of discourse. But to urge on that account
5279: that we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of
5280: international relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests
5281: of our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call
5282: obtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and
5283: cheaply idle living to be found. In meeting the national evils which are
5284: brought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no
5285: more immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller
5286: national excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more
5287: excellent individual natives. The tendency of things is towards the
5288: quicker or slower fusion of races. It is impossible to arrest this
5289: tendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it
5290: from degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement
5291: of those national traditions and customs which are the language of the
5292: national genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment. Such moderating
5293: and guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort. And it is
5294: in this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities
5295: has value. That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form
5296: a state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government
5297: has been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and
5298: in virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European
5299: councils. Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though
5300: far-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination. We
5301: have to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before
5302: we can be sure of our ground.
5303: 
5304: The only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,
5305: that England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule. The fiery
5306: resolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of
5307: pitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic
5308: people. Why? Because there is a national life in our veins. Because
5309: there is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely
5310: worth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it.
5311: Because we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in that spirit
5312: of separateness which has not yet done its work in the education of
5313: mankind, which has created the varying genius of nations, and, like the
5314: Muses, is the offspring of memory.
5315: 
5316: Here, as everywhere else, the human task seems to be the discerning and
5317: adjustment of opposite claims. But the end can hardly be achieved by
5318: urging contradictory reproaches, and instead of labouring after
5319: discernment as a preliminary to intervention, letting our zeal burst
5320: forth according to a capricious selection, first determined accidentally
5321: and afterwards justified by personal predilection. Not only John Gilpin
5322: and his wife, or Edwin and Angelina, seem to be of opinion that their
5323: preference or dislike of Russians, Servians, or Greeks, consequent,
5324: perhaps, on hotel adventures, has something to do with the merits of the
5325: Eastern Question; even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we
5326: find a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferers of different blood
5327: or votaries of differing religions, strangely unaccountable on any other
5328: ground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstances of
5329: travel. With some even admirable persons, one is never quite sure of any
5330: particular being included under a general term. A provincial physician,
5331: it is said, once ordering a lady patient not to eat salad, was asked
5332: pleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce, or
5333: cresses, or radishes. The physician had too rashly believed in the
5334: comprehensiveness of the word "salad," just as we, if not enlightened by
5335: experience, might believe in the all-embracing breadth of "sympathy with
5336: the injured and oppressed." What mind can exhaust the grounds of
5337: exception which lie in each particular case? There is understood to be a
5338: peculiar odour from the negro body, and we know that some persons, too
5339: rationalistic to feel bound by the curse on Ham, used to hint very
5340: strongly that this odour determined the question on the side of negro
5341: slavery.
5342: 
5343: And this is the usual level of thinking in polite society concerning the
5344: Jews. Apart from theological purposes, it seems to be held surprising
5345: that anybody should take an interest in the history of a people whose
5346: literature has furnished all our devotional language; and if any
5347: reference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure
5348: to state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for
5349: her part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very
5350: unpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,
5351: though on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their
5352: characteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he
5353: has blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone. Again, men
5354: who consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing
5355: history and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their
5356: contemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the
5357: Jews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own
5358: agreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a
5359: transformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying
5360: "civilisation" as a transformed tribal existence of which some
5361: lineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native
5362: Australians. Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name
5363: "Father" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their
5364: view of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of
5365: things in which nobody knew his own father?
5366: 
5367: For less theoretic men, ambitious to be regarded as practical
5368: politicians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their
5369: unfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage. But it
5370: is possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of
5371: Walpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse
5372: to accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen
5373: as the standard of value for the English people and the part they have
5374: to play in the fortunes of mankind.
5375: 
5376: If we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems
5377: reasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to
5378: complete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing
5379: every remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in
5380: the breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or
5381: what we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,
5382: actually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions
5383: scattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political
5384: relations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the
5385: restoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of
5386: national feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel
5387: for special energies which may contribute some added form of national
5388: genius, and an added voice in the councils of the world?
5389: 
5390: They are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of
5391: them. Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form
5392: Unions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them. If we wish to
5393: free ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,
5394: whether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all
5395: means of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,
5396: and of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels. Why
5397: are we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps
5398: we have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or
5399: literature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at
5400: the notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of
5401: thinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer
5402: which we end with an Amen? Some of us consider this question dismissed
5403: when they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake
5404: their European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem. But in a return
5405: from exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether
5406: certain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be
5407: found worthy men who will choose to lead the return. Plenty of
5408: prosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of
5409: forty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his
5410: race, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world
5411: which has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore. The
5412: hinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of
5413: feeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that
5414: among its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and
5415: ardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will
5416: know how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by
5417: heroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of
5418: their foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their
5419: people once more one among the nations.
5420: 
5421: Formerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of
5422: prophecy in the "restoration of the Jews." Such interpretation of the
5423: prophets is less in vogue now. The dominant mode is to insist on a
5424: Christianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth
5425: having a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions. The
5426: Christ of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--"Go ye first to the lost
5427: sheep of the house of Israel." The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart
5428: of a Jew: "For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
5429: brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom
5430: pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the
5431: giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are
5432: the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came." Modern
5433: apostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they
5434: prefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase. But the
5435: mediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the
5436: days of Augustus. Pagans in successive ages said, "These people are
5437: unlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them." The Jews
5438: were steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness
5439: Christianity was born. A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from
5440: the freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may
5441: be enriched. Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy
5442: of a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down? There is still a
5443: great function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should
5444: shut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his
5445: national history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance
5446: which that history has left him. Every Jew should be conscious that he
5447: is one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal
5448: achievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to
5449: them a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in
5450: faculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new
5451: beneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the
5452: traditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.
5453: 
5454: There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought
5455: forth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the
5456: world, is bound by their visions.
5457: 
5458: Is bound?
5459: 
5460: Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy
5461: child of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,
5462: feels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and
5463: the possible renovation of his national family.
5464: 
5465: Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his
5466: doctrine a philosophy? He will teach a blinding superstition--the
5467: superstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in
5468: disregard of the influences which have made us human.
5469: 
5470: 
5471: THE END.
